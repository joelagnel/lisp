Mon Oct 18 19:07:56 1993  Eero Simoncelli  (eero@tarpon.cis.upenn.edu)

	* modified cl-strip-file-extension (in cl-shell.el) so that it
	does the right thing if the full file name has "."s in it.

	* Strip file extension off pathname in cl-load-file, so that
	lucid's load function can find the binary files.

Mon Jun  7 20:33:20 1993  Eero Simoncelli  (eero@tarpon.cis.upenn.edu)

	* Added variable *cl-pathname-prefix-string* to allow handling
	alternate syntax for pathname printing (bug reported by Tom Green,
	tmgreen@athena.mit.edu for KCL).

Fri Nov 13 15:03:11 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at whitechapel)

    	* edit-definition code in cl-lucid.el modified to tell you if the
	symbol has no function binding.

Sun Sep 27 16:45:31 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at cockfosters)

	* Modified cl-send-string-with-echo to narrow region before
	inenting sexp.  Otherwise, Emacs might need to scan a large
	portion of the buffer....

Mon Aug 10 22:15:44 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at oxfordcircus)

	* Fixed cl-compile-form to send all compilations directly to CL
	(no more temp files!).  If the form is not a defun (or other form
	matching the cl-fast-compile-regexp), it is wrapped in a lambda
	expression and passed to "compile".  Thus, cl-compile-form now
	returns the result of the compilation!  Remaining improvement:
	get rid of user::compile-def (since this requires gross stuff
	to be sent to CL at startup), and just determine in Emacs what
	kind of expression to pass to CL (see cl-buglist).

Fri Jul  3 01:50:19 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at victoria)

	* Added new variable *cl-confirm-input*.  Modified
	cl-shell-send-input to use it.  If it is non-nil, then typing
	<CR> in the middle of the *lisp* buffer causes the S-expression to
	be COPIED to the end of the buffer, but not sent to Lisp until you
	type a second <CR>.  If it is nil, the expression is sent immediately.

	* Fixed run-cl and run-obvius to read program filename with
	completion if prefix arg is used.

Thu Jul  2 01:37:44 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at oxfordcircus)

	* Fixed cl-arglist function to do the right thing for "defun" and
	all other "def"-<thing> expressions.  Also for "map"-<thing>
	expressions (like mapcar).

Tue Jun  2 17:56:07 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at oxfordcircus)

	* Fixed minor bug in previous change: cl-get-function-name was
	giving an error if it couldn't determine the function.

Thu May 28 14:16:31 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at oxfordcircus)

	* source-file-editing and arglist requests now ALWAYS prompt for a
	symbol name.  It was too magic (especially for
	source-file-editing) to act without asking for confirmation.

Wed Apr 29 12:46:27 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at knightsbridge)

	* Made cl-send-startup-commands interactive.

Sat Mar 28 18:17:06 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at newton.arc.nasa.gov)

	* Fixed *cl-definition-regexp-alist* so that source file code
	doesn't match substrings of symbol names.

	* Modified meaning of the *cl-pop-up* parameter. This variable
	can now take on values as follows:
         t       => pop up when anything appears in the *lisp* buffer, including
	            echoed commands to CL.
         'output => pop up when CL outputs a prompt
         'error  => pop up when CL outputs an error prompt
         nil     => never pop up automatically

	* Fixed cl-documentation to mention what package was looked in if
	symbol is unbound.

Wed Mar 25 18:05:18 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at whitechapel)

	* Fix startup procedure: emacs code only initializes when a
	non-error prompt is output by lisp.  This prevents the mess that
	used to happen when the user had an error in a startup file!

Fri Feb 14 19:19:21 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at oxfordcircus)

	* Added rest of "map" functions to Jan 30 fix of cl-arglist.

Wed Feb  5 15:45:25 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at oxfordcircus)

	* Fixed kill-ring bug in x-copy-sexp, x-replace-sexp, x-move-sexp
	and x-move-and-replace-sexp (small modification to
	insert-indented-sexp in misc-extensions.el).

Sun Feb  2 22:21:06 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at oxfordcircus)

	* Added patches by Jonathan Bachrach to record source files of
	defgeneric forms (in cl-clos.el and source-file-extensions.lisp).

Thu Jan 30 19:20:46 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at oxfordcircus)

	* Fixed cl-arglist function to do the right thing for "apply" and
	"funcall" expressions.  Required minor modifications to
	cl-get-function-name (in cl-lucid.el) and cl-add-quote (in
	cl-shell.el).

Sat Jan 25 18:53:21 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at oxfordcircus)

	* Added sun-X-fn-key.el code to distribution.  This file provides
	a simple mechanism for binding the function keys on a Sun4/SPARC
	keyboard.

Thu Jan  9 17:34:37 1992  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at picadilly)

	* Additions to misc-extensions.el:
	  - Modfied lisp-fill-paragraph to work on doc-strings (only when
	    point is before beginning of string!)
	  - Added split-window-and-switch-buffer function, with suggested
	    binding in example.emacs.
	  - Modified find-file-noselect (in example.emacs) to expand symlinks.
	  - Added insert-double-quotes, grow-list-forward, and
	    my-insert-parentheses, with suggested bindings in example.emacs.

Sun Sep 15 18:42:27 1991  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at whitechapel)

	* Added cl-apropos.  Bound to "C-c C-h" (help).  Changed binding
	of cl-describe to "C-c C-i" (info).

Thu Aug  8 17:36:12 1991  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at hydepark)

	* Fixed cl-describe to work on the sexp at the cursor.

Mon Jul  1 19:08:20 1991  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at poisson.arc.nasa.gov)

	* Fixed the cl-edit-definition to handle secondary (:before,
	:after, and :around) methods.  Changes only in cl-clos.el.

Sat Apr  6 08:42:27 1991  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at aldwych)

	* Added some useful mouse functions to misc-extensions.el.

Mon Apr  1 23:37:29 1991  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at oxfordcircus)

	* Fixed the startup code so that hooks run for the cl-shell
	(*lisp* buffer) mode (when the first CL prompt is received)
	are run with the buffer set to the cl-buffer.

Tue Mar 19 14:44:11 1991  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at marblearch)

	* Changed the pop-up help behavior.  Doesn't use electric help
	mode any more, which was VERY annoying.  You can still type
	<space> to bury the buffer immediately, and I added a new key
	binding C-cC-q to bury it at any time later.

Sun Mar 17 01:12:30 1991  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at marblearch)

	* misc-extensions.el: Wrote expand-symlinks to expand all symlinks
	in a file name.  This is a useful thing to do to the
	buffer-file-name of .lisp buffers, since Lucid does this to
	filenames when recording source-file information.  Put an example
	of how to use this into example.emacs.

	* shell-history.el: Wrote non-matching history-yanking functions.
	Default bindings are M-n and M-p for matching functions (both
	directions) , C-M-y and C-M-z for non-matching functions.  The
	non-matching functions  insert the history strings at the current
	point, whereas the matching ones insert them at the process-mark
	(where the user's newest input is entered).

	* cl-lucid.el: added bindings "C-c <digit>" to send single
	digits to the lisp process.  This is useful for continuations
	from the debugger.

Wed Jan 16 18:28:22 1991  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at marblearch)

	* Added files cl-shell.doc (small file of documentation), and
	example.emacs (an example .emacs file).

Thu Nov 29 17:48:53 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at whitechapel)

	* Improved the source-pathname problem -- Emacs now asks
	Common Lisp to expand the filename into its truename.

Sun Oct 14 13:54:52 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at victoria)

	* Got rid of package prefixes in arglists.

	* If error occurs when processing a special stream (ie during
	arglist, macroexpansion, etc) we print the error prompt into the
	*lisp* buffer to let the user know they are in a debug level!

Tue Sep 18 14:58:57 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at marblearch)

	* Made file cl-clos.el.  This is loaded if you are running CLOS in
	Lucid.  Didn't want to add another file, but had to do it to
	prevent the CLOS stuff from screwing up FLAVORS.

Fri Sep  7 18:37:05 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at aldwych)

    	* Changed commands using *compilation* buffer to use a buffer
	called *CL compilation*.

	* Added variable *shell-history-min-string-length* to not record
	history if string length is too short. (e.g. t, nil, :a).

Tue Aug 28 14:20:52 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at newton.arc.nasa.gov)

	* Added cl-send-request, which makes cl-send-help-request
	obsolete.  This function abstracts out all requests of CL.  It
	should be more sophisticated for lisps with multi-processing!

	* Altered cl-remove-newlines to remove all excess whitespace for
	text to be displayed in the minibuffer.  Renamed it
	cl-shrink-whitespace.

Fri Aug 24 11:15:16 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at newton.arc.nasa.gov)

	* Added a few key bindings to electric-help-map in cl-shell.el.  
	Added same bindings to cl-choose-definition-map in cl-lucid.el.
	Added file cl-shell.doc to describe the bindings.

	* Made Lisp print out message when it is receiving Emacs startup
	commands.

	* Fixed print-length bug in CL formats in cl-documentation and
	cl-edit-definition.

Tue Aug 14 10:22:37 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at newton.arc.nasa.gov)

	* Added some code to cl-lucid to make cl-edit-definition work for
	Lucid-4.0 CLOS definitions (i.e. classes and methods).

	* Added modified compile-def definition to cl-lucid for compiling
	Lucid-4.0 CLOS methods directly.

	* Adjusted cl-send-startup-commands so as not to cause a secondary
	error if CL has an error when starting up.  [*** This still needs to
	be fixed to only send the startup stuff when a NON-ERROR prompt is 
	output].

	* Small modification of cl-compile-form to echo a form like
	(compile-def '(my-defun junk ... ) :pkg 'user) into the *lisp*
	buffer (previously did not echo the function name).

Wed Aug  8 16:15:36 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at newton.arc.nasa.gov)

	* Added prefix arg to cl-macroexpand-1 (C-cC-m).  With prefix, 
	inserts the lowercased macroexpansion of the current s-expression
	AT THE POINT.

Tue Jul 17 15:10:24 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at newton.arc.nasa.gov)

	* Fixed cl-macroexpand-1, cl-describe, and cl-arglist to call
	write instead of pprint and to set keywords :print-level and
	:print-length to nil.

Mon Jun 18 18:38:43 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at aldwych.media.mit.edu)

	* Fixed cl-edit-definition bug for symbols with question marks or
	other Emacs-lisp special characters.  It now asks CL to pass back 
	an S-expression containing a string instead of a symbol.

Fri Jun 15 19:56:10 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at knightsbridge)

	* Fixed strange bug in source-file-extensions.lisp that prevented 
	redefinitions from happening.  When the advice to
	record-source-file does not call apply-advice-continue, the defun
	is not actually evaluated!

Sun May 13 19:31:41 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at picadilly.media.mit.edu)

	* Fixed cl-send-string-with-echo to save history in the
	history-ring of the *lisp* buffer (it used to save it in it's own
	history ring!).

Thu Apr 26 14:54:59 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at knightsbridge)

	* Added function cl-goto-lisp-buffer (suggested by Steve
	Strassman).

Wed Apr 25 14:25:48 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at demille)

	* Added ".hpbin" to completion-ignored-extensions in cl-lucid.el.

Wed Apr 18 10:50:44 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at demille)

	* Got rid of calls to setf in shell-history.el, so that the
	Emacs file cl.el is no longer required.

Sun Apr  1 19:02:11 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at hydepark)

	* Fixed source-file-extensions.lisp so that it doesn't record
	multiple source files.  This still needs to be fixed to handle
	redefinition warnings properly.

	* Fixed cl-pcl code to work with Victoria Day PCL.  The definition
	of compile-function-and-methods was originally written for the
	12/88 PCL and occasionally broke in the 5/89 version.  I have not
	tried it in the 2/90 (Rainy Day) version!

Fri Mar 30 13:29:31 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at knightsbridge)

	* Fixed startup sequence so that Emacs doesn't send the startup
	commands to CL until CL comes up to top level (ie Emacs waits
	until it sees a prompt).  This seems a little more robust, since
	it doesn't stuff a lot of characters onto the CL input stream
	before CL is ready to deal with them.  Still flakes out a bit
	when there is an error during CL startup.  Maybe it should
	send the startup commands when it sees a NON-error prompt!

Thu Mar 29 20:26:44 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at aldwych.media.mit.edu)

	* Fixed source-file code to locally bind *print-length* -- it was
	printing "..." when there were lots of source files for a symbol.

Wed Mar 28 22:56:15 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at westminster.media.mit.edu)

	* Rewrote the history code to use a ring instead of a buffer.  It now
	searches for history commands matching the current input substring.

Thu Mar 22 02:08:57 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at whitechapel.media.mit.edu)

	* Changed some key bindings to be more consistent.  C-c followed
	by a raw character is used for commands which change the state of
	the CL environment.  C-c followed by a control character is used
	for commands which are (hopefully) side-effect free such as the
	various help commands.
	
	* Altered cl-eval-form in cl-lucid.el to not preserve the source
	file since this junk was being recorded in the history.  This is
	not the right solution, but until I solidify the treatment of
	packages and source files, it will have to do.

Mon Mar  5 18:46:31 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at picadilly.media.mit.edu)

	* Fixed cl-eval-region in cl-lucid.el also.

Sun Mar  4 19:47:05 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at knightsbridge.media.mit.edu)

	* Fixed cl-eval-region to work correctly if point is before mark!
	I hadn't noticed the bug since I rarely use cl-eval-region.

Sat Mar  3 18:50:11 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at demille)

	* Changed cl-concatenate-stream-id to take an optional
	close-marker parameter.  If this is t, then it concatenates
	both a close marker and an open marker.  Otherwise, it just
	expects the stream to terminate with a lisp prompt.  Changed
	cl-load-required-el-code to call cl-concatenate-stream-id with
	the new parameter set to t.

	* Altered cl-parse-output to remove input-id-marker in nested
	stream clause.

Fri Mar  2 12:09:07 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at picadilly.media.mit.edu)

	* Added C-cp binding to set buffer package.

Thu Mar  1 21:47:47 1990  Eero Simoncelli  (eero at demille)

	* Fixed cl-send-string-with-echo to add a newline to the string
	that is history-recorded.  Also fixed it in cl-lucid.  I think 
	this fixes the missing closing paren problem.

	* Fixed cl-output-filter to set buffer to the one in the selected
	window.  This allows cl-goto-definition to work properly.

	* Changed cl-goto-definition to select the window of the
	source-file buffer (at the end of the function).

Tue Feb 27 ~00:30 1990   Eero Simoncelli   (eero at knightsbridge)

	* Fixed stuff in cl-shell.el so that files cl-lucid, cl-pcl,
	cl-flavors are loaded rather than required.  This is necessary
	(well, not for cl-lucid), since they send things to lisp at
	startup.
