This is the `anim/README' file of GNU eev.
All files in this directory were created by Eduardo Ochs
<edrx@mat.puc-rio.br> and are in the Public Domain.

If you are reading this file locally, after unpacking
<http://angg.twu.net/eev-current.tar.gz> in your machine, you will
notice that the HTML files in this directory point to SWF files that
are only at the upstream version of this directory, which is at
<http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/anim/>. The SWF files are not being
included in the eev package just because of their size and because
they do not change frequently; they were also created by me (Eduardo
Ochs), and are in the public domain. If you'd like to make your local
htmls works do this:

  cd ~/eev-current/
  wget http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/anim/channels.swf
  wget http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/anim/gdb.swf


VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: many people - including me!!! Aaargh!!! - are
using tools that are "gratis" but not "libre" to display Shockwave
Flash movies, even though SWF's specs are open... Please check
<http://gplflash.sourceforge.net/>, and consider helping that project
if you have the skills! It can already display these animations when
run in standalone mode (with just a few glitches, like some wrong
pixels), and it seems that it is possible to use it as a
not-very-stable plugin for Mozilla/Firefox, but I haven't tried that
yet... COMING SOON: e-scripts about compiling gplflash and running it
both as a standalone program and as a plugin!
