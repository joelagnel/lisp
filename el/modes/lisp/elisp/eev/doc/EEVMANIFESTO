The eev Manifesto
=================

I)

Do you remember your first Unix days, when you were always asking yourself
questions like "how do I compile this?", "how do I install this stuff?", "and
now, how do I run it?", "how do I generate html from this file?"?

Do you remember how you marvelled at the first time you ran a "make" on a
package and you saw echoed each of the commands that were used to generate
binaries and docs from the source? Have you had the same feeling I've had,
that by understanding those commands we would have access to the tricks that
the owner of the package knew, and that we'd learn which were the "important"
programs and in what way the experts used them?

II)

Everybody is fluent in only a small fraction of all Unix commands. If you
could "listen" to how the Unix gurus "speak" to their machines you would learn
which "words" are related to solving a particular task, and learn how they fit
in "sentences". By checking the "dictionary entries" for them (i.e., manpages,
info pages, READMEs, source code, etc) you could learn the real meaning of
them. But then you'd be learning Unix by immersion, from real use, instead of
having to rely only on "textbooks", "dictionaries" and sometimes "Rosetta
stones", "graffitis on toilet walls" and "old newspapers".

The fact is that you can make a record of how you "speak" Unix, and more, you
can become a lot more productive if you do so. Many tasks consist on short
fixed sequences of commands: connecting to your ISP via modem, unpacking a
source package and recompiling it, printing a text file in two-column mode,
and so on. The trick is that with some functions defined in eev.el you can
write these sequences of commands in a plain text file, then mark a block of
this file with your editor (which must be Emacs for this to work), then tell a
shell to execute only the commands in that block; in this way you can easily
execute only portions of what would otherwise have to be a monolythic script;
this is great for when you're not sure if everything works, or if you just
want to do some steps. Also, it would be easy to change bits of the "script"
before execution, as you'll be doing things from inside an editor.

There is also another trick. Scripts allow "comments", that is, lines that are
not executed; generally the convention is that lines that start with "#" are
comments. So we can place lines like these in a script:

  # (find-enode "Picture" "C-c c-c")

The expression "(find-enode "Picture")" is an Emacs command (in Lisp) that
means: open the "info page" called "Picture", from the Emacs manual, treating
it as a file; then place the cursor after the first occurrence of the string
"C-c c-c" there. To execute this command, i.e., to make emacs go to that point
on that page, you just have to put the cursor after the ")" and type C-x C-e.
There are many other similar commands, that will open specific files or
specific manpages, with various ways of searching. These "hyperlinks" are
especially interesting if you want to record from where you got some piece of
information relevant to the "script" you're writing; this is very useful, for
example, on "scripts" you haven't finished and on which you plan to work more
someday, or on scripts you want to send to someone.

Just as hyperlinks have many flavors, the function that executes a block also
has variants: a block can be executed by the Tcl interpreter instead of the
shell, or can be run through LaTeX, just to pick some examples. See the docs
on eev.el (<http:/angg.twu.net/eev-current/README.html>).

III)

I have placed essentially all my "scripts" written in this way (I call
them "e-scripts") in a public place (<http:/angg.twu.net/e/>). They
contain almost everything I know about Unix.

If you like this idea, please get in touch, send comments, ask questions --
about e-scripts or questions whose answer could become an e-script chunk -- or
send me your e-scripts when you have some, or even ask for help on setting up
your own e-script collection or e-script public site... anything! By asking
good questions you can help me make the documentation get better.

I really want to make this e-scripts idea spread. Learning Unix -- or simply
more Unix -- could be made easier for everybody... please help! E-scripts are
funnier to use, and easier to write, than texts that tell everything in terms
of "press this, do that". A lot of effort and money are being invested now on
these kinds of text, and they're often very depressing. Let's try to save the
world from them, at least a bit, and maybe this money will be directed to
better things. And teaching people Unix tricks will be both easier and
funnier.
