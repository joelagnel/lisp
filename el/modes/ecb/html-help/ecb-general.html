Normal hook run at the end of activating the ecb-package by running
<code>ecb-activate</code>. This hooks are run after all the internal setup
process but directly before(!) drawing the layout specified in
<code>ecb-layout</code> (means before dividing the frame into several
windows).

<p>A senseful using of this hook can be maximizing the Emacs-frame for
example, because this should be done before the layout is drawn
because ECB computes the size of the ECB-windows with the current
frame size! If you need a hook-option for the real end of the
activating process (i.e. after the layout-drawing) look at
<code>ecb-activate-hook</code>.

<p>IMPORTANT: The difference between this hook and
<code>ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook</code> is that the latter one is
evaluated always before the layout is redrawn (for example after
calling <code>ecb-redraw-layout</code>) whereas the former one (this hook)
is only evaluated exactly once during the activation-process of ECB. 
So during the activation process there is the following sequence of
hooks:
<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li><code>ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook</code> \(this one)
<li><code>ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook</code>
<li>&lt;Drawing the layout&gt;

How ECB displays bucket-nodes in a ECB tree-buffer. Bucket-nodes have
only one job: Nodes with similar properties will be dropped into one
bucket for such a common property and all these nodes will be added as
children to the bucket-node. Besides being expandable and collapsable
a bucket-node has no senseful action assigned. Examples for
bucket-nodes are "[+] Variables, "[+] Dependencies" etc. in the
Methods-buffer or buckets which combine filenames with same extension
under a bucket-node with name this extension.

<p>This option defines how bucket-node should be displayed. The name of
the bucket-node is computed by ECB but you can define a prefix, a
suffix and a special face for the bucket-node

<p>The default are empty prefix/suffix-strings and
<code>ecb-bucket-node-face</code>. But an alternative can be for example
'("[" "]" nil) which means no special face and a display like
"[+] [&lt;bucket-name&gt;]".

Clear all ECB internal caches before startup. If t then ECB clears all
its internal caches before starting up. Caches are used for files- and
subdirs (see <code>ecb-cache-directory-contents</code> and
<code>ecb-cache-directory-contents-not</code>) for semantic-tags and for
the history-filter.

<p>This caches are completely clean at load-time of the ECB-library!

<p>Default is nil, because is makes sense not to clear these caches at
start-time because ECB is often deacticated temporally especially in
combination with window-managers like escreen.el. In these situations
the internal state of ECB should be preserved for next activation.

Normal hook run at the end of <code>ecb-current-buffer-sync</code>.

<p>See documentation of <code>ecb-current-buffer-sync</code> for conditions when
synchronization takes place and so in turn these hooks are evaluated.

<p>Precondition for such a hook:
Current buffer is the buffer of the current selected edit-window.

<p>Postcondition for such a hook:
Point must stay in the same edit-window as before evaluating the hook.

<p>Important note: If <code>ecb-window-sync</code> is not nil
<code>ecb-current-buffer-sync</code> is running either every time Emacs is
idle or even after every command (see <code>ecb-window-sync-delay</code>). 
So these hooks can be really called very often! Therefore each
function of this hook should/must check in an efficient way at
beginning if its task have to be really performed and then do them
only if really necessary! Otherwise performance of Emacs could slow
down dramatically!

<p>It is strongly recommended that each function added to this hook uses
the macro <code>ecb-do-if-buffer-visible-in-ecb-frame</code> at beginning! 
See <code>ecb-speedbar-current-buffer-sync</code> and
<code>ecb-eshell-current-buffer-sync</code> for examples how to use this
macro!

Specifies all keybindings for the ECB minor-mode key-map. The value is

keybindings. The cdr is a list of keybindings each of them a list
again. A key-binding has the following form:

</pre>

<dl>
<dt><code>&lt;common-prefix-flag&gt;</code>
<dd>If t then the common-prefix-key defined as car of the value (see above)
is used.

<br><dt><code>&lt;keysequence&gt;</code>
<dd>If the common prefix-key is used then the final key-binding is the
concatenation of the common-prefix-key (see above) and this
keysequence.

<br><dt><code>&lt;function&gt;:</code>
<dd>The function to bind to the key. This can also be a lambda-expression
. 
</dl>

<p>It is highly recommended to use one of the standard keys C-c or C-x as
first key of your common-prefix-key!

<p>You MUST change this option via customize to take effect!

<p>All keysequences must be inserted as a string and must follow the
syntax needed by <code>read-kbd-macro</code> or <code>kbd</code>. This means you
can insert the key in the same manner <kbd>C-h k</kbd> displays keysequences. 
Here is the summary of the syntax:

<p>Text is divided into "words" separated by whitespace. Except for the words
described below, the characters of each word go directly as characters of the
keysequence. The whitespace that separates words is ignored. Whitespace in the
macro must be written explicitly, as in <kbd>C-c SPC</kbd>.

<ul>
<li>The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent
special control characters. The words must be written in uppercase.

<li>A word in angle brackets, e.g., &lt;return&gt;, &lt;down&gt;, &lt;left&gt; or &lt;f1&gt;,
represents a function key. (Note that in the standard configuration,
the function key &lt;return&gt; and the control key RET are synonymous.). 
You can use angle brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they are
not required there.

<li>Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed by
up to six octal digits. This is the only way to represent keys with
codes above ÿ.

<li>One or more prefixes M- (meta), C- (control), S- (shift), A- (alt), H-
(hyper), and s- (super) may precede a character or key notation. For
function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the brackets:
C-&lt;down&gt; = &lt;C-down&gt;. The prefixes may be written in any order: M-C-x =
C-M-x. Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc,
except that the Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and
optional minus sign: M-123 = M- M-1 M-2 M-3.

<li>The <code>^</code> notation for control characters also works: ^M = C-m. 
</ul>

are two possible choices:

<ul>
<li><code>left-top</code>:
Does the "right" action always in the left/topmost edit-window. 
<li><code>last-point</code>:
Does the "right" action always in that edit-window which had the point
before. 
</ul>
This is if the user has clicked either with the primary mouse-button or
has activated a popup-menu in the tree-buffer.

<p>If the edit-area is not splitted this setting doesn't matter.

<p>A click with the secondary mouse-button (see again
<code>ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons</code> does the "right" action
always in another edit-window related to the setting in this option:
If there are two edit-windows then the "other" edit-window is used
and for more than 2 edit-windows the "next" edit-window is used
(whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window is the first
edit-window).

<p>Note: If the tree-buffers are used with the keyboard instead with the
mouse then this option takes effect too because <kbd>RET</kbd> is
interpreted as primary mouse-button and <kbd>C-RET</kbd> as secondary
mouse-button!
