AUC TeX
*******

   AUC TeX is an integrated environment for editing LaTeX and TeX files.

   This file almost documents AUC TeX version 12.

   Although AUC TeX contains a large number of features, there are no
reasons to despair.  You can continue to write TeX and LaTeX documents
the way you are used to, and only start using the multiple features in
small steps.  AUC TeX is not monolithic, each feature described in this
manual is useful by itself, but together they provide an environment
where you will make very few LaTeX errors, and makes it easy to find
the errors that may slip through anyway.

   If you want to make AUC TeX aware of style files and multi-file
documents right away, insert the following in your `.emacs' file.
     (setq TeX-auto-save t)
     (setq TeX-parse-self t)
     (setq-default TeX-master nil)

   NOTE: This documentation is preliminary.  It should however cover
most important points.  Corrections or perhaps rewrites of sections are
VERY WELCOME.

Introduction to AUC TeX
***********************

   This section of the AUC TeX manual gives a brief overview of what AUC
TeX is, and the section is also available as a `README' file.  It is
*not* an attempt to document AUC TeX.  Real documentation for AUC TeX
is available in the rest of the manual, which you can find in the `doc'
directory.

   Read the `INSTALLATION' file for information about how to install
AUC TeX.  It is identical to the Installation chapter in the AUC TeX
manual.

   If you are upgrading from the previous version of AUC TeX, the
latest changes can be found in the `CHANGES' file.  If you are
upgrading from an older version, read the History chapter in the AUC
TeX manual.

   AUC TeX is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for
writing input files for LaTeX using GNU Emacs.

   AUC TeX lets you run TeX/LaTeX and other LaTeX-related tools, such
as a output filters or post processor from inside Emacs.  Especially
`running LaTeX' is interesting, as AUC TeX lets you browse through the
errors TeX reported, while it moves the cursor directly to the reported
error, and displays some documentation for that particular error.  This
will even work when the document is spread over several files.

   AUC TeX automatically indents your `LaTeX-source', not only as you
write it -- you can also let it indent and format an entire document.
It has a special outline feature, which can greatly help you `getting an
overview' of a document.

   Apart from these special features, AUC TeX provides a large range of
handy Emacs macros, which in several different ways can help you write
your LaTeX documents fast and painlessly.

   All features of AUC TeX are documented using the GNU Emacs online
documentation system.  That is, documentation for any command is just a
key click away!

   AUC TeX is written entirely in Emacs-Lisp, and hence you can easily
add new features for your own needs.  It was not made as part of any
particular employment or project (apart from the AUC TeX project
itself).  AUC TeX is distributed under the `GNU Emacs General Public
License' and may therefore almost freely be copied and redistributed.

   The next sections are a short introduction to some `actual' features.
For further information, refer to the built-in online documentation of
AUC TeX.

Indentation and formatting
==========================

   AUC TeX may automatically indent your document as you write it. By
pressing <lfd> instead of <ret> at the end of a line, the current line
is indented by two spaces according to the current environment level,
and the cursor is moved down one line.  By pressing <tab>, the current
line is indented, and the cursor stays where it is.  The well-known
Emacs feature `format-paragraph' (`M-q') is reimplemented especially
for AUC TeX to follow the indentation.  A special command
`LaTeX-fill-buffer' lets you indent an entire document like the
well-known C utility indent (this time, only according to the LaTeX
structure :-).

Completion
==========

   By studying your `\documentclass' command (in the top of your
document), and consulting a precompiled list of (La)TeX symbols from a
large number of TeX and LaTeX files, AUC TeX is aware of the LaTeX
commands you should be able to use in this particular document.  This
`knowledge' of AUC TeX is used for two purposes.

  1. To make you able to `complete' partly written LaTeX commands. You
     may e.g. write `\renew' and press `M-<tab>'
     (`TeX-complete-symbol'), and then AUC TeX will complete the word
     `\renewcommand' for you. In case of ambiguity it will display a
     list of possible completions.

  2. To aid you inserting environments, that is \begin - \end pairs.
     This is done by pressing C-c C-e (LaTeX-environment), and you will
     be prompted for which `environment' to insert.

Editing your document
=====================

   A number of more or less intelligent keyboard macros have been
defined to aid you editing your document.  The most important are
listed below.

`LaTeX-environment'
     (`C-c C-e') Insert a `\begin{}' -- `\end{}' pair as described
     above.

`LaTeX-section'
     (`C-c C-s') Insert one of `\chapter', `\section', etc.

`TeX-font'
     (`C-c C-f C-r', `C-c C-f C-i', `C-c C-f C-b') Insert one of
     `\textrm{ }'), `\textit{ \/}' `\textbf{ }' etc.

   A number of additional functions are available.  But it would be far
too much to write about here.  Refer to the rest of the AUC TeX
documentation for further information.

Running LaTeX
=============

   When invoking one of the commands `TeX-command-master' (`C-c C-c')
or `TeX-command-region' (`C-c C-r') LaTeX is run on either the entire
current document or a given region of it.  The Emacs view is split in
two, and the output of TeX is printed in the second half of the screen,
as you may simultaneously continue editing your document.  In case TeX
find any errors when processing your input you can call the function
`TeX-next-error' (`C-c `') which will move the cursor to the first
given error, and display a short explanatory text along with the
message TeX gave.  This procedure may be repeated until all errors have
been displayed.  By pressing `C-c C-w' (`TeX-toggle-debug-boxes') you
can toggle whether the browser also should notify over-full/under-full
boxes or not.

   Once you've successfully formatted your document, you may preview or
print it by invoking `TeX-command-master' again.

Outlines
========

   Along with AUC TeX comes support for outline mode for Emacs, which
lets you browse the sectioning structure of your document, while you
will still be able to use the full power of the rest of the AUC TeX
functionality.

Availability
============

   The most recent version is always available at

               <http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/auctex/stable.pkg/>

   WWW users may want to check out the AUC TeX page at

                                        <http://www.nongnu.org/auctex/>

Contacts
========

   There has been established a mailing list for help, bug reports,
feature requests and general discussion about AUC TeX.  You're very
welcome to join.  Traffic average at an article by day, but they come
in bursts.  If you are only interested in information on updates, you
could refer to the newsgroups `comp.text.tex' and `gnu.emacs.sources'.

   If you want to contact the AUC TeX mailing list, send mail to
<mailto:auc-tex-subscribe@sunsite.dk> in order to join.  Articles

Inserting Frequently Used Commands
**********************************

   The most commonly used commands/macros of AUC TeX are those which
simply insert templates for often used TeX and/or LaTeX constructs,
like font changes, handling of environments, etc.  These features are
very simple, and easy to learn, and help you avoid stupid mistakes like
mismatched braces, or `\begin{}'-`\end{}' pairs.

* Quotes::                      Inserting double quotes
* Font Specifiers::             Inserting Font Specifiers

* Environments::                Inserting Environment Templates


File: auctex,  Node: Quotes,  Next: Font Specifiers,  Prev: Frequently Used Commands,  Up: Frequently Used Commands

Insertion of Quotes, Dollars, and Braces
========================================

   In TeX, literal double quotes `"like this"' are seldom used, instead
two single quotes are used ```like this'''.  To help you insert these
efficiently, AUC TeX allows you to continue to press `"' to insert two
single quotes.  To get a literal double quote, press `"' twice.

 - Command: TeX-insert-quote COUNT
     (`"') Insert the appropriate quote marks for TeX.

     Inserts the value of `TeX-open-quote' (normally ```') or
     `TeX-close-quote' (normally `''') depending on the context.  With
     prefix argument, always inserts `"' characters.

 - User Option: TeX-open-quote
     String inserted by typing `"' to open a quotation.

 - User Option: TeX-close-quote
     String inserted by typing `"' to close a quotation.

   If you include the style file `german' `TeX-open-quote' and
`TeX-close-quote' will both be set to `"'.

   In AUC TeX, dollar signs should match like they do in TeX.  This has
been partially implemented, we assume dollar signs always match within
a paragraph.  The first `$' you insert in a paragraph will do nothing
special.  The second `$' will match the first.  This will be indicated
by moving the cursor temporarily over the first dollar sign.  If you
enter a dollar sign that matches a double dollar sign `$$' AUC TeX will
automatically insert two dollar signs.  If you enter a second dollar
sign that matches a single dollar sign, the single dollar sign will
automatically be converted to a double dollar sign.

 - Command: TeX-insert-dollar ARG
     (`$') Insert dollar sign.

     Show matching dollar sign if this dollar sign end the TeX math
     mode.  Ensure double dollar signs match up correctly by inserting
     extra dollar signs when needed.

     With optional ARG, insert that many dollar signs.

   To avoid unbalanced braces, it is useful to insert them pairwise.
You can do this by typing `C-c {'.

 - Command: TeX-insert-braces
     (`C-c {') Make a pair of braces and position the cursor to type
     inside of them.

Inserting Font Specifiers
=========================

   Perhaps the most used keyboard commands of AUC TeX are the short-cuts
available for easy insertion of font changing macros.  They all put the
font change inside a TeX group, a practice that help preventing subtle
errors.  The most significant advantage of using these command instead
of typing it in yourself, is that the braces will always match
correctly.

   If you give an argument (that is, type `C-u') to the font command,
the innermost font will be replaced, i.e. the font in the TeX group
around point will be changed.  The following table shows the available
commands, with `-!-' indicating the position where the text will be
inserted.

`C-c C-f C-r'
     Insert roman \textrm{-!-} text.

`C-c C-f C-b'
     Insert bold face `\textbf{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-i'
     Insert italics `\textit{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-e'
     Insert emphasized `\emph{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-s'
     Insert slanted `\textsl{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-t'
     Insert typewriter `\texttt{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-c'
     Insert SMALL CAPS `\textsc{-!-}' text.

`C-c C-f C-d'
     Delete the innermost font specification containing point.

 - Command: TeX-font ARG
     (`C-c C-f') Insert template for font change command.

     If REPLACE is not nil, replace current font.  WHAT determines the
     font to use, as specified by `TeX-font-list'.

 - User Option: TeX-font-list
     List of fonts used by TeX-font.

     Each entry is a list with three elements.  The first element is the
     key to activate the font.  The second element is the string to
     insert before point, and the third element is the string to insert
     after point.  An optional fourth element means always replace if
     not nil.

Inserting chapters, sections, etc.
==================================

   Insertion of sectioning macros, that is `\chapter', `\section',
`\subsection', etc. and accompanying `\label''s may be eased by using
`C-c C-s'.  This command is highly customizable, the following
describes the default behavior.

   When invoking you will be asked for a section macro to insert.  An
appropriate default is automatically selected by AUC TeX, that is
either: at the top of the document; the top level sectioning for that
document style, and any other place: The same as the last occurring
sectioning command.

   Next, you will be asked for the actual name of that section, and
last you will be asked for a label to be associated with that section.
The label will be prefixed by the value specified in
`LaTeX-section-hook'.

 - Command: LaTeX-section ARG
     (`C-c C-s') Insert a sectioning command.

     Determine the type of section to be inserted, by the argument ARG.

        * If ARG is nil or missing, use the current level.

        * If ARG is a list (selected by C-u), go downward one level.

        * If ARG is negative, go up that many levels.

        * If ARG is positive or zero, use absolute level:
             + 0 : part

             + 1 : chapter

             + 2 : section

             + 3 : subsection

             + 4 : subsubsection

             + 5 : paragraph

             + 6 : subparagraph

     The following variables can be set to customize the function.

    `LaTeX-section-hook'
          Hooks to be run when inserting a section.

    `LaTeX-section-label'
          Prefix to all section references.


   The precise behavior of `LaTeX-section' is defined by the contents
of `LaTeX-section-hook'.

 - User Option: LaTeX-section-hook
     List of hooks to run when a new section is inserted.

     The following variables are set before the hooks are run

    LEVEL
          Numeric section level, default set by prefix arg to
          `LaTeX-section'.

    NAME
          Name of the sectioning command, derived from LEVEL.

    TITLE
          The title of the section, default to an empty string.

    TOC
          Entry for the table of contents list, default nil.

    DONE-MARK
          Position of point afterwards, default nil meaning after the
          inserted text.

     A number of hooks are already defined.  Most likely, you will be
     able to get the desired functionality by choosing from these hooks.

    `LaTeX-section-heading'
          Query the user about the name of the sectioning command.
          Modifies LEVEL and NAME.

    `LaTeX-section-title'
          Query the user about the title of the section. Modifies TITLE.

    `LaTeX-section-toc'
          Query the user for the toc entry.  Modifies TOC.

    `LaTeX-section-section'
          Insert LaTeX section command according to NAME, TITLE, and
          TOC.  If TOC is nil, no toc entry is inserted.  If TOC or
          TITLE are empty strings, DONE-MARK will be placed at the
          point they should be inserted.

    `LaTeX-section-label'
          Insert a label after the section command.  Controlled by the
          variable `LaTeX-section-label'.

     To get a full featured `LaTeX-section' command, insert

          (setq LaTeX-section-hook
                '(LaTeX-section-heading
                  LaTeX-section-title
                  LaTeX-section-toc
                  LaTeX-section-section
                  LaTeX-section-label))

     in your `.emacs' file.

   The behavior of `LaTeX-section-label' is determined by the variable
`LaTeX-section-label'.

 - User Option: LaTeX-section-label
     Default prefix when asking for a label.

     If it is a string, it is used unchanged for all kinds of sections.
     If it is nil, no label is inserted.  If it is a list, the list is
     searched for a member whose car is equal to the name of the
     sectioning command being inserted.  The cdr is then used as the
     prefix.  If the name is not found, or if the cdr is nil, no label
     is inserted.

     By default, chapters have a prefix of `cha:' while sections and
     subsections have a prefix of `sec:'.  Labels are not automatically
     inserted for other types of sections.

Inserting Environment Templates
===============================

   A large apparatus is available that supports insertions of
environments, that is `\begin{}' -- `\end{}' pairs.

   AUC TeX is aware of most of the actual environments available in a
specific document.  This is achieved by examining your `\documentclass'
command, and consulting a precompiled list of environments available in
a large number of styles.

   You insert an environment with `C-c C-e', and select an environment
type.  Depending on the environment, AUC TeX may ask more questions
about the optional parts of the selected environment type.  With `C-u
C-c C-e' you will change the current environment.

 - Command: LaTeX-environment ARG
     (`C-c C-e')  AUC TeX will prompt you for an environment to insert.
     At this prompt, you may press <TAB> or <SPC> to complete a
     partially written name, and/or to get a list of available
     environments.  After selection of a specific environment AUC TeX
     may prompt you for further specifications.

     If the optional argument ARG is not-nil (i.e. you have given a
     prefix argument), the current environment is modified and no new
     environment is inserted.

   As a default selection, AUC TeX will suggest the environment last
inserted or, as the first choice the value of the variable
`LaTeX-default-environment'.

 - User Option: LaTeX-default-environment
     Default environment to insert when invoking `LaTeX-environment'
     first time.

   If the document is empty, or the cursor is placed at the top of the
document, AUC TeX will default to insert a `document' environment.

   Most of these are described further in the following sections, and
you may easily specify more, as described in `Customizing environments'.

* Menu:

* Equations::                   Equations
* Floats::                      Floats

* Tabular-like::                Tabular-like
* Customizing environments::    Customizing environments

   You can close the current environment with `C-c ]', but we suggest
that you use `C-c C-e' to insert complete environments instead.

 - Command: LaTeX-close-environment
     (`C-c ]') Insert an `\end' that matches the current environment.

Equations
---------

   When inserting equation-like environments, the `\label' will have a
default prefix, which is controlled by the following variables:

 - User Option: LaTeX-equation-label
     Prefix to use for `equation' labels.

 - User Option: LaTeX-eqnarray-label
     Prefix to use for `eqnarray' labels.

 - User Option: LaTeX-amsmath-label
     Prefix to use for amsmath equation labels.  Amsmath equations
     include `align', `alignat', `xalignat', `aligned', `flalign' and
     `gather'.


File: auctex,  Node: Floats,  Next: Itemize-like,  Prev: Equations,  Up: Environments

Floats
------

   Figures and tables (i.e., floats) may also be inserted using AUC TeX.
After choosing either `figure' or `table' in the environment list
described above, you will be prompted for a number of additional things.

FLOAT-TO
     This field is the option of float environments that controls how
     they are placed in the final document.  In LaTeX this is a
     sequence of the letters `htbp' as described in the LaTeX manual.
     The value will default to the value of `LaTeX-float'.

CAPTION
     This is the caption of the float.

LABEL
     The label of this float.  The label will have a default prefix,
     which is controlled by the variables `LaTeX-figure-label' and
     `LaTeX-table-label'.

   Moreover, in the case of a `figure' environment, you will be asked if
you want to insert a `center' environment inside the figure.

 - User Option: LaTeX-float
     Default placement for floats.

 - User Option: LaTeX-figure-label
     Prefix to use for figure labels.

 - User Option: LaTeX-table-label
     Prefix to use for table labels.

Itemize-like
------------

   In an itemize-like environment, nodes (i.e., `\item's) may be
inserted using `C-c <LFD>'.

 - Command: LaTeX-insert-item
     (`C-c <LFD>') Close the current item, move to the next line and
     insert an appropriate `\item' for the current environment. That is,
     `itemize' and `enumerate' will have `\item ' inserted, while
     `description' will have `\item[]' inserted.

some features for entering more specialized sorts of text, and for
indenting and navigating through the document.

Entering Mathematics
====================

   TeX is written by a mathematician, and has always contained good
support for formatting mathematical text.  AUC TeX supports this
tradition, by offering a special minor mode for entering text with many
mathematical symbols.  You can enter this mode by typing `C-c ~'.

 - Command: LaTeX-math-mode
     (`C-c ~') Toggle LaTeX-math-mode.  This is a minor mode rebinding
     the key `LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix' to allow easy typing of
     mathematical symbols.  ``' will read a character from the keyboard,
     and insert the symbol as specified in `LaTeX-math-list'.  If given
     a prefix argument, the symbol will be surrounded by dollar signs.

   You can use another prefix key (instead of ``') by  setting the
variable LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix.

 - User Option: LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix
     A string containing the prefix of `LaTeX-math-mode' commands; This
     value defaults to ``'.

   The variable `LaTeX-math-list' holds the actual mapping.

 - User Option: LaTeX-math-list
     A list containing key command mappings to use in `LaTeX-math-mode'.
     The car of each element is the key and the cdr is the macro name.

   The AUC TeX distributions includes a reference card for
`LaTeX-math-mode' with a list of all math mode commands.

Completion
==========

   Emacs lisp programmers probably know the `lisp-complete-symbol'
command, usually bound to `M-<TAB>'.  Users of the wonderful ispell
mode know and love the `ispell-complete-word' command from that
package.  Similarly, AUC TeX has a `TeX-complete-symbol' command,
usually bound to `M-<TAB>'.  Using `LaTeX-complete-symbol' makes it
easier to type and remember the names of long LaTeX macros.

   In order to use `TeX-complete-symbol', you should write a backslash
and the start of the macro.  Typing `M-<TAB>' will now complete as much
of the macro, as it unambiguously can.  For example, if you type
``\renewc'' and then ``M-<TAB>', it will expand to ``\renewcommand''.

 - Command: TeX-complete-symbol
     (`M-<TAB>')  Complete TeX symbol before point.

   A more direct way to insert a macro is with `TeX-insert-macro',
bound to `C-c C-m'.  It has the advantage over completion that it knows
about the argument of most standard LaTeX macros, and will prompt for
them.  It also knows about the type of the arguments, so it will for
example give completion for the argument to `\include'.  Some examples
are listed below.

 - Command: TeX-insert-macro
     (`C-c C-m') Prompt (with completion) for the name of a TeX macro,
     and if AUC TeX knows the macro, prompt for each argument.

   As a default selection, AUC TeX will suggest the macro last inserted
or, as the first choice the value of the variable `TeX-default-macro'.

 - User Option: TeX-default-macro
     Default macro to insert when invoking `TeX-insert-macro' first
     time.

   A faster alternative is to bind the function `TeX-electric-macro' to
`\'.  This can be done by setting the variable `TeX-electric-escape'

 - User Option: TeX-electric-escape
     If this is non-nil when AUC TeX is loaded, the TeX escape
     character `\' will be bound to `TeX-electric-macro'

   The difference between `TeX-insert-macro' and `TeX-electric-macro'
is that space will complete and exit from the minibuffer in
`TeX-electric-macro'.  Use <TAB> if you merely want to complete.

 - Command: TeX-electric-macro
     Prompt (with completion) for the name of a TeX macro, and if AUC
     TeX knows the macro, prompt for each argument.  Space will
     complete and exit.

   By default AUC TeX will put an empty set braces `{}' after a macro
with no arguments to stop it from eating the next whitespace.  This can
be stopped by entering `LaTeX-math-mode', *note Mathematics::, or by
setting `TeX-insert-braces' to nil

 - User Option: TeX-insert-braces
     If non-nil, append a empty pair of braces after inserting a macro.

   Completions work because AUC TeX can analyze TeX files, and store
symbols in emacs lisp files for later retrieval.  *Note Automatic::, for
more information.

   AUC TeX will also make completion for many macro arguments, for
example existing labels when you enter a `\ref' macro with
`TeX-insert-macro' or `TeX-electric-macro', and BibTeX entries when you
enter a `\cite' macro.  For this kind of completion to work, parsing
must be enabled as described in *note Parsing Files::.  For `\cite' you
must also make sure that the BibTeX files have been saved at least once
after you enabled automatic parsing on save, and that the basename of
the BibTeX file does not conflict with the basename of one of TeX files.

Commenting
==========

   It is often necessary to comment out temporarily a region of TeX or
LaTeX code.  This can be done with the commands `C-c ;' and `C-c %'.
`C-c ;' will comment out all lines in the current region, while `C-c %'
will comment out the current paragraph.  To uncomment, simply type `C-u
- C-c ;' to uncomment all lines in the region, or `C-u - C-c %'
uncomment all comment lines around point.

   By default, these commands will insert or remove a single `%'.  To
insert more than one, give an argument. `C-u 5 C-c %' will add five `%'
to each line, while `C-u - 5 C-c %' will remove up to 5 `%' from each
line.

 - Command: TeX-comment-region COUNT
     (`C-c ;') Add or remove `%' from the beginning of each line in the
     current region, as specified by COUNT.

 - Command: TeX-comment-paragraph COUNT
     (`C-c %') Add or remove `%' from the beginning of each line in the
     current paragraph, as specified by COUNT.  When removing `%''s the
     paragraph is considered to consist of all preceding and succeeding
     lines starting with a `%', until the first non-comment line.

Marking, Formatting and Indenting
=================================

   AUC TeX contains very advanced handling of indentation and
reformatting of the LaTeX source.  If you have already tried AUC TeX
with `auto-fill-mode' enabled, you may have noted that the source is
automatically indented and formatted as you write it.  More over, AUC
TeX is able to format sections of text on demand.

   It is important to realize, that AUC TeX comes with `formatting' in
two fashions.  Either letting TeX format the file, or letting AUC TeX
make the ASCII document look better.

   Indentation is done by LaTeX environments and by TeX groups, that is
the body of an environment is indented by the value of
`LaTeX-indent-level' (default 2).  Also, items of an `itemize-like'
environment are indented by the value of `LaTeX-item-indent', default
-2.  This indentation makes it easier to see the structure of the
document, and to catch errors such as a missing close brace.  Thus, the
indentation is done for precisely the same reasons that you would
indent ordinary computer programs.

   The following is a short sample of an itemize environment indented by
AUC TeX.  If more environments are nested, they are indented
`accumulated' just like most programming languages usually are seen
indented in nested constructs.

     \begin{itemize}
     \item Insertion of templates for logical-structural compositions such as
       environments and sections.
     \item Hot-keys for easy access to certain often used constructs, e.g.,
       font changes, accented letters, and mathematical symbols.
     \item Running application programs (such as \TeX), and then parsing
       the output so that errors in the document may be located
       easily.
     \item Support for multi-file documents.
     \item Online help for \AllTeX\ error messages.
     \item Outlining\Dash i.e., manipulating the document as a composition
       of nested/sequential logical constructs.
     \item Instant formatting and indentation of the \ascii-document in
       order to make it easier to read.
     \item `Completion' (and thereby spell-checking) of partially written
       control sequences.
     \end{itemize}

   You can format and indent single lines, paragraphs, environments, or
sections.

`<TAB>'
     `LaTeX-indent-line' will indent the current line.

`<LFD>'
     `reindent-then-newline-and-indent' indents the current line, and
     then inserts a new line (much like <RET>) and move the cursor to an
     appropriate position by the left margin.

`M-q'
     Alias for `C-c C-q C-p'

`C-c C-q C-p'
     `LaTeX-fill-paragraph' will reformat or `fill' the current
     paragraph.

`C-c C-q C-e'
     `LaTeX-fill-environment' will reformat or `fill' the current
     environment.  This may e.g. be the `document' environment, in
     which case the entire document will be formatted.

`C-c C-q C-s'
     `LaTeX-fill-section' will reformat or `fill' the current logical
     sectional unit.

`M-g'
     Alias for `C-c C-q C-r'

`C-c C-q C-r'
     `LaTeX-fill-region' will format or `fill' the current region.

   *Warning:* The formatting cannot handle tabular-like environments.
Those will be completely messed-up if you try to format them.

 - User Option: LaTeX-indent-level
     Number of spaces to add to the indentation for each `\begin' not
     matched by a `\end'.

 - User Option: LaTeX-item-indent
     Number of spaces to add to the indentation for `\item''s in list
     environments.

 - User Option: TeX-brace-indent-level
     Number of spaces to add to the indentation for each `{' not
     matched by a `}'.


File: auctex,  Node: Outline,  Prev: Marking and formatting,  Up: Advanced Features

Outlining the Document
======================

   AUC TeX supports the standard outline minor mode using LaTeX
sectioning commands as header lines.  *Note Outline Mode:
(emacs)Outline Mode.  By default `outline-minor-mode' will use the
prefix key `C-c' which is also used by AUC TeX, so it is suggested that
you choose another prefix key by inserting

       (setq outline-minor-mode-prefix "\C-c\C-o") ; Or whatever...

   in your `.emacs' file.

   You can add your own headings by setting the variable
`TeX-outline-extra'.

 - Variable: TeX-outline-extra
     List of extra TeX outline levels.

     Each element is a list with two entries.  The first entry is the
     regular expression matching a header, and the second is the level
     of the header.  A `^' is automatically prepended to the regular
     expressions in the list, so they must match text at the beginning
     of the line.

     See `LaTeX-section-list' for existing header levels.

   The following example add `\item' and `\bibliography' headers, with
`\bibliography' at the same outline level as `\section', and `\item'
being below `\subparagraph'.

     (setq TeX-outline-extra
           '(("[ \t]*\\\\\\(bib\\)?item\\b" 7)
             ("\\\\bibliography\\b" 2)))

   You may want to check out the unbundled `out-xtra' package for even
better outline support.  It is available from your favorite emacs lisp
archive.

Formatting and Printing
***********************

   The most powerful features of AUC TeX may be those allowing you to
run (La)TeX and other external commands like BibTeX and `makeindex'
from within Emacs, viewing and printing the results, and moreover
allowing you to _debug_ your documents.

* Menu:

* Commands::                    Invoking external commands.
* Debugging::                   Debugging TeX and LaTeX output.

Executing Commands
==================

   Formatting the document with TeX or LaTeX, viewing with a previewer,
printing the document, running BibTeX, making an index, or checking the
document with `lacheck' or `chktex' all require running an external
command.

   There are two ways to run an external command, you can either run it
on all of the current documents with `TeX-command-master', or on the
current region with `TeX-command-region'.

 - Command: TeX-command-master
     (`C-c C-c')  Query the user for a command, and run it on the master
     file associated with the current buffer.  The name of the master
     file is controlled by the variable `TeX-master'.  The available
     commands are controlled by the variable `TeX-command-list'.

   *Note Installation::, for a discussion about `TeX-command-list' and
*Note Multifile:: for a discussion about `TeX-master'.

 - Command: TeX-command-region
     (`C-c C-r') Query the user for a command, and run it on the "region
     file".  Some commands (typically those invoking TeX or LaTeX) will
     write the current region into the region file, after extracting the
     header and tailer from the master file.  If mark is not active,
     use the old region.  The name of the region file is controlled by
     the variable `TeX-region'.  The name of the master file is
     controlled by the variable `TeX-master'.  The header is all text
     up to the line matching the regular expression `TeX-header-end'.
     The trailer is all text from the line matching the regular
     expression `TeX-trailer-start'.  The available commands are
     controlled by the variable `TeX-command-list'.

   AUC TeX will allow one process for each document, plus one process
for the region file to be active at the same time.  Thus, if you are
editing N different documents, you can have N plus one processes
running at the same time.  If the last process you started was on the
region, the commands described in *Note Debugging:: and *Note Control::
will work on that process, otherwise they will work on the process
associated with the current document.

 - User Option: TeX-region
     The name of the file for temporarily storing the text when
     formatting the current region.

 - User Option: TeX-header-end
     A regular expression matching the end of the header.  By default,
     this is `\begin{document}' in LaTeX mode and `%**end of header' in
     TeX mode.

 - User Option: TeX-trailer-start
     A regular expression matching the start of the trailer.  By
     default, this is `\end{document}' in LaTeX mode and `\bye' in TeX
     mode.

   AUC TeX will try to guess what command you want to invoke, but by
default it will assume that you want to run TeX in TeX mode and LaTeX
in LaTeX mode.  You can overwrite this by setting the variable
`TeX-command-default'.

 - User Option: TeX-command-default
     The default command to run in this buffer.  Must be an entry in
     `TeX-command-list'.

   If you want to overwrite the values of `TeX-header-end',
`TeX-trailer-start', or `TeX-command-default', you can do that for all
files by setting them in either `TeX-mode-hook', `plain-TeX-mode-hook',
or `LaTeX-mode-hook'.  To overwrite them for a single file, define them
as file variables (*note File Variables: (emacs)File Variables.).  You
do this by putting special formatted text near the end of the file.

     % Local Variables:
     % TeX-header-end: "% End-Of-Header"
     % TeX-trailer-start: "% Start-Of-Trailer"
     % TeX-command-default: "SliTeX"
     % End:

   AUC TeX will try to save any buffers related to the document, and
check if the document needs to be reformatted.  If the variable
`TeX-save-query' is non-nil, AUC TeX will query before saving each
file.  By default AUC TeX will check emacs buffers associated with
files in the current directory, in one of the `TeX-macro-private'
directories, and in the `TeX-macro-global' directories.  You can change
this by setting the variable `TeX-check-path'.

 - User Option: TeX-check-path
     Directory path to search for dependencies.

     If nil, just check the current file.  Used when checking if any
     files have changed.

Catching the errors
===================

   Once you've formatted your document you may `debug' it, i.e. browse
through the errors (La)TeX reported.

 - Command: TeX-next-error
     (`C-c `')  Go to the next error reported by TeX.  The view will be
     split in two, with the cursor placed as close as possible to the
     error in the top view.  In the bottom view, the error message will
     be displayed along with some explanatory text.

   Normally AUC TeX will only report real errors, but you may as well
ask it to report `bad boxes' as well.

 - Command: TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes
     (`C-c C-w')  Toggle whether AUC TeX should stop at bad boxes (i.e.
     over/under full boxes) as well as at normal errors.

   As default, AUC TeX will display that special `*help*' buffer
containing the error reported by TeX along with the documentation.
There is however an `expert' option, which allows you to display the
real TeX output.

 - User Option: TeX-display-help
     When non-nil AUC TeX will automatically display a help text
     whenever an error is encountered using `TeX-next-error' (`C-c `').


File: auctex,  Node: Checking,  Next: Control,  Prev: Debugging,  Up: Formatting

Checking for problems
=====================

   Running TeX or LaTeX will only find regular errors in the document,
not examples of bad style.  Furthermore, description of the errors may
often be confusing.  The utility `lacheck' can be used to find style
errors, such as forgetting to escape the space after an abbreviation or
using `...' instead of `\ldots' and many other problems like that.  You
start `lacheck' with `C-c C-c C h e c k <RET>'.  The result will be a
list of errors in the `*compilation*' buffer.  You can go through the
errors with `C-x `' (`next-error', *note Compilation:
(emacs)Compilation.), which will move point to the location of the next
error.

   Another newer program which can be used to find errors is `chktex'.
It is much more configurable than `lacheck', but doesn't find all the
problems `lacheck' does, at least in its default configuration.  You
must install the programs before using them, and for `chktex' you must
also modify `TeX-command-list'.  You can get `lacheck' from
`<URL:ftp://sunsite.dk/pub/text/lacheck/>' or alternatively `chktex'
from `<URL:ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/tex/support/chktex/>'.  Search for
`chktex' in `tex.el' to see how to switch between them.

Controlling the output
======================

   A number of commands are available for controlling the output of an
application running under AUC TeX

 - Command: TeX-kill-job
     (`C-c C-k')  Kill currently running external application.  This
     may be either of TeX, LaTeX, previewer, BibTeX, etc.

 - Command: TeX-recenter-output-buffer
     (`C-c C-l')  Recenter the output buffer so that the bottom line is
     visible.

 - Command: TeX-home-buffer
     (`C-c ^') Go to the `master' file in the document associated with
     the current buffer, or if already there, to the file where the
     current process was started.

Multifile Documents
*******************

   You may wish to spread a document over many files (as you are likely
to do if there are multiple authors, or if you have not yet discovered
the power of the outline commands (*note Outline::)).  This can be done
by having a "master" file in which you include the various files with
the TeX macro `\input' or the LaTeX macro `\include'.  These files may
also include other files themselves.  However, to format the document
you must run the commands on the top level master file.

   When you, for example, ask AUC TeX to run a command on the master
file, it has no way of knowing the name of the master file.  By default,
it will assume that the current file is the master file.  If you insert
the following in your `.emacs' file AUC TeX will use a more advanced
algorithm.

     (setq-default TeX-master nil) ; Query for master file.

   If AUC TeX finds the line indicating the end of the header in a
master file (`TeX-header-end'), it can figure out for itself that this
is a master file.  Otherwise, it will ask for the name of the master
file associated with the buffer.  To avoid asking you again, AUC TeX
will automatically insert the name of the master file as a file
variable (*note File Variables: (emacs)File Variables.).  You can also
insert the file variable yourself, by putting the following text at the
end of your files.

     % Local Variables:
     % TeX-master: "master"
     % End:

   You should always set this variable to the name of the top level
document.  If you always use the same name for your top level
documents, you can set `TeX-master' in your `.emacs' file.

     (setq-default TeX-master "master") ; All master files called "master".

 - User Option: TeX-master
     The master file associated with the current buffer.  If the file
     being edited is actually included from another file, then you can
     tell AUC TeX the name of the master file by setting this variable.
     If there are multiple levels of nesting, specify the top level
     file.

     If this variable is `nil', AUC TeX will query you for the name.

     If the variable is `t', then AUC TeX will assume the file is a
     master file itself.

     If the variable is `shared', then AUC TeX will query for the name,
     but will not change the file.

     It is suggested that you use the File Variables (*note File
     Variables: (emacs)File Variables.) to set this variable permanently
     for each file.

 - User Option: TeX-one-master
     Regular expression matching ordinary TeX files.

     You should set this variable to match the name of all files, for
     which it is a good idea to append a `TeX-master' file variable
     entry automatically.  When AUC TeX adds the name of the master
     file as a file variable, it does not need to ask next time you
     edit the file.

     If you dislike AUC TeX automatically modifying your files, you can
     set this variable to `"<none>"'.  By default, AUC TeX will modify
     any file with an extension of `.tex'.

   AUC TeX keeps track of macros, environments, labels, and style files
that are used in a given document.  For this to work with multifile
documents, AUC TeX has to have a place to put the information about the
files in the document.  This is done by having an `auto' subdirectory
placed in the directory where your document is located.  Each time you
save a file, AUC TeX will write information about the file into the
`auto' directory.  When you load a file, AUC TeX will read the
information in the `auto' directory about the file you loaded _and the
master file specified by `TeX-master'_.  Since the master file (perhaps
indirectly) includes all other files in the document, AUC TeX will get
information from all files in the document.  This means that you will
get from each file, for example, completion for all labels defined
anywhere in the document.

   AUC TeX will create the `auto' directory automatically if
`TeX-auto-save' is non-nil.  Without it, the files in the document will
not know anything about each other, except for the name of the master
file.  *Note Automatic Local::.

 - Command: TeX-save-document
     (`C-c C-d') Save all buffers known to belong to the current
     document.

 - User Option: TeX-save-query
     If non-nil, then query the user before saving each file with
     `TeX-save-document'.
