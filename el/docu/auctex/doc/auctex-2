Automatic Parsing of TeX files.
*******************************

   AUC TeX depends heavily on being able to extract information from the
buffers by parsing them.  Since parsing the buffer can be somewhat slow,
the parsing is initially disabled.  You are encouraged to enable them by
adding the following lines to your `.emacs' file.

     (setq TeX-parse-self t) ; Enable parse on load.
     (setq TeX-auto-save t) ; Enable parse on save.

   The later command will make AUC TeX store the parsed information in
an `auto' subdirectory in the directory each time the TeX files are
stored, *note Automatic Local::.  If AUC TeX finds the pre-parsed
information when loading a file, it will not need to reparse the buffer.
The information in the `auto' directory is also useful for multifile
documents *note Multifile::, since it allows each file to access the
parsed information from all the other files in the document.  This is
done by first reading the information from the master file, and then
recursively the information from each file stored in the master file.

   The variables can also be done on a per file basis, by changing the
file local variables.

     % Local Variables:
     % TeX-parse-self: t
     % TeX-auto-save: t
     % End:

   Even when you have disabled the automatic parsing, you can force the
generation of style information by pressing `C-c C-n'.  This is often
the best choice, as you will be able to decide when it is necessary to
reparse the file.

 - User Option: TeX-parse-self
     Parse file after loading it if no style hook is found for it.

 - User Option: TeX-auto-save
     Automatically save style information when saving the buffer.

 - Command: TeX-normal-mode ARG
     (`C-c C-n') Remove all information about this buffer, and apply the
     style hooks again.  Save buffer first including style information.
     With optional argument, also reload the style hooks.

   When AUC TeX saves your buffer, it will by default convert all tabs
in your buffer into spaces.  To disable this behaviour, insert the
following in your `.emacs' file.

     (setq TeX-auto-untabify nil)

 - User Option: TeX-auto-untabify
     Automatically remove all tabs from a file before saving it.

   Instead of disabling the parsing entirely, you can also speed it
significantly up by limiting the information it will search for (and
store) when parsing the buffer.  You can do this by setting the default
values for the buffer local variables `TeX-auto-regexp-list' and
`TeX-auto-parse-length' in your `.emacs' file.

     ;; Only parse \documentstyle information.
     (setq-default TeX-auto-regexp-list 'LaTeX-auto-minimal-regexp-list)
     ;; The documentstyle command is usually near the beginning.
     (setq-default TeX-auto-parse-length 2000)

   This example will speed the parsing up significantly, but AUC TeX
will no longer be able to provide completion for labels, macros,
environments, or bibitems specified in the document, nor will it know
what files belong to the document.

   These variables can also be specified on a per file basis, by
changing the file local variables.

     % Local Variables:
     % TeX-auto-regexp-list: TeX-auto-full-regexp-list
     % TeX-auto-parse-length: 999999
     % End:

 - User Option: TeX-auto-regexp-list
     List of regular expressions used for parsing the current file.

 - User Option: TeX-auto-parse-length
     Maximal length of TeX file that will be parsed.

   The pre-specified lists of regexps are defined below.  You can use
these before loading AUC TeX by quoting them, as in the example above.

 - Constant: TeX-auto-empty-regexp-list
     Parse nothing

 - Constant: LaTeX-auto-minimal-regexp-list
     Only parse documentstyle.

 - Constant: LaTeX-auto-label-regexp-list
     Only parse LaTeX labels.

 - Constant: LaTeX-auto-regexp-list
     Parse common LaTeX commands.

 - Constant: plain-TeX-auto-regexp-list
     Parse common plain TeX commands.

 - Constant: TeX-auto-full-regexp-list
     Parse all TeX and LaTeX commands that AUC TeX can use.

Internationalization
********************

   There are several problems associated with editing non-English TeX
with GNU Emacs.  Modern versions of GNU Emacs and TeX are usable for
European (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek) based languages, but special versions
of TeX and Emacs are needed for Korean, Japanese, and Chinese.

* Menu:

Using AUC TeX for European languages.
=====================================

   First you will need a way to write non-ASCII characters.  You can
either use macros, or teach TeX about the ISO character sets.  I prefer
the latter, it has the advantage that the usual standard emacs word
movement and case change commands will work.

   With LaTeX2e, just add `\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}'.  Other
languages than Western European ones will probably have other encoding
needs.

   To be able to display non-ASCII characters you will need an
appropriate font and a version of GNU Emacs capable of displaying 8-bit
characters.  The manner in which this is supported differs between
Emacsen, so you need to take a look at your respective documentation.

   A compromise is to use use an European character set when editing the
file, and convert to TeX macros when reading and writing the files.

`iso-cvt.el'
     Much like `iso-tex.el' but is bundled with Emacs 19.23 and later.

`x-compose.el'
     Similar package bundled with new versions of XEmacs.

`X-Symbol'
     a much more complete package for both Emacs and XEmacs that can
     also handle a lot of mathematical characters and input methods.

   AUC TeX supports style files for several languages.  Each style file
may modify some AUC TeX to better support the language, and will run a
language specific hook that will allow you to for example change ispell
dictionary, or run code to change the keyboard remapping.  The
following will for example choose a Danish dictionary for documents
including the `dk.sty' file.  This requires parsing to be enabled,
*note Parsing Files::.

     (add-hook 'TeX-language-dk-hook
               (function (lambda () (ispell-change-dictionary "danish"))))

   The following style files are recognized.
`dk'
     Runs style hook `TeX-language-dk-hook'.

`dutch'
     Runs style hook `TeX-language-nl-hook'.

`german'
     Runs style hook `TeX-language-de-hook'.  Gives  `"' word syntax
     and makes the <"> key insert a literal `"'.

`plfonts'
`plhb'
     Runs style hook `TeX-language-pl-hook'.  Gives  `"' word syntax
     and makes the <"> key insert a literal `"'.  Pressing <"> twice
     will insert `"<' or `">' depending on context.

Japanese TeX
============

   To write Japanese text with AUC TeX you need to have versions of TeX
and Emacs that support Japanese.  There exist at least two variants of
TeX for Japanese text (jTeX and pTeX), and AUC TeX can be used with
MULE supported Emacsens.

   To install Japanese support for AUC TeX, copy `tex-jp.el' to AUC TeX
installed directory.  Next two commands will automatically install
contributed files.

     make contrib
     make install-contrib

   See `INSTALLATION' and `Makefile' for more information.

   To use the Japanese TeX variants, simply enter `japanese-tex-mode',
`japanese-latex-mode', or `japanese-slitex-mode', and everything should
work.  If not, send mail to Shinji Kobayashi
`<koba@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>', who kindly donated the code for supporting
Japanese in AUC TeX.  None of the primary AUC TeX maintainers
understand Japanese, so they can not help you.

   If you usually use AUC TeX in Japanese, setting following variables
is useful.

 - User Option: TeX-default-mode
     Mode to enter for a new file when it can't be determined whether
     the file is plain TeX or LaTeX or what.

     To use Japanese TeX always, set japanese command for example:
          (setq TeX-default-mode 'japanese-latex-mode)

 - User Option: japanese-TeX-command-default
     The default command for TeX-command in japanese TeX mode.

     The default value is `jTeX'.

 - User Option: japanese-LaTeX-command-default
     The default command for TeX-command in japanese LaTeX mode.

     The default value is `jLaTeX'.

 - User Option: japanese-LaTeX-default-style
     The default style/class when creating new japanese LaTeX document.

     The default value is `j-article'.

   See `tex-jp.el' for more information.

Automatic Customization
***********************

   Since AUC TeX is so highly customizable, it makes sense that it is
able to customize itself.  The automatic customization consists of
scanning TeX files and extracting symbols, environments, and things
like that.

   The automatic customization is done on three different levels.  The
global level is the level shared by all users at your site, and consists
of scanning the standard TeX style files, and any extra styles added
locally for all users on the site.  The private level deals with those
style files you have written for your own use, and use in different
documents.  You may have a `~/lib/TeX/' directory where you store
useful style files for your own use.  The local level is for a specific
directory, and deals with writing customization for the files for your
normal TeX documents.

   If compared with the environment variable `TEXINPUTS', the global
level corresponds to the directories built into TeX.  The private level
corresponds to the directories you add yourself, except for `.', which
is the local level.

* Menu:

* Automatic Global::            Automatic Customization for the Site
* Automatic Private::           Automatic Customization for a User
* Automatic Local::             Automatic Customization for a Directory

   By default AUC TeX will search for customization files in all the
global, private, and local style directories, but you can also set the
path directly.  This is useful if you for example want to add another
person's style hooks to your path.  Please note that all matching files
found in `TeX-style-path' are loaded, and all hooks defined in the
files will be executed.

 - User Option: TeX-style-path
     List of directories to search for AUC TeX style files.  Each must
     end with a slash.

   By default, when AUC TeX searches a directory for files, it will
recursively search through subdirectories.

 - User Option: TeX-file-recurse
     Whether to search TeX directories recursively: nil means do not
     recurse, a positive integer means go that far deep in the directory
     hierarchy, t means recurse indefinitely.

   By default, AUC TeX will ignore files name `.', `..', `SCCS', `RCS',
and `CVS'.

 - User Option: TeX-ignore-file
     Regular expression matching file names to ignore.

     These files or directories will not be considered when searching
     for TeX files in a directory.

Automatic Customization for the Site
====================================

   Assuming that the automatic customization at the global level was
done when AUC TeX was installed, your choice is now: will you use it?
If you use it, you will benefit by having access to all the symbols and
environments available for completion purposes.  The drawback is slower
load time when you edit a new file and perhaps too many confusing
symbols when you try to do a completion.

   You can disable the automatic generated global style hooks by setting
the variable `TeX-auto-global' to nil.

 - User Option: TeX-macro-global
     Directories containing the site's TeX style files.

 - User Option: TeX-style-global
     Directory containing hand generated TeX information.  Must end
     with a slash.

     These correspond to TeX macros shared by all users of a site.

 - User Option: TeX-auto-global
     Directory containing automatically generated information.

     For storing automatic extracted information about the TeX macros
     shared by all users of a site.


File: auctex,  Node: Automatic Private,  Next: Automatic Local,  Prev: Automatic Global,  Up: Automatic

Automatic Customization for a User
==================================

   You should specify where you store your private TeX macros, so AUC
TeX can extract their information.  The extracted information will go
to the directories listed in `TeX-auto-private'

   Use `M-x TeX-auto-generate' to extract the information.

 - User Option: TeX-macro-private
     Directories where you store your personal TeX macros.  Each must
     end with a slash.

     This defaults to the directories listed in the `TEXINPUTS' and
     `BIBINPUTS' environment variables.

 - User Option: TeX-auto-private
     List of directories containing automatically generated information.
     Must end with a slash.

     These correspond to the personal TeX macros.

 - Command: TeX-auto-generate TEX AUTO
     (`M-x TeX-auto-generate') Generate style hook for TEX and store it
     in AUTO.  If TEX is a directory, generate style hooks for all
     files in the directory.

 - User Option: TeX-style-private
     List of directories containing hand generated information.  Must
     end with a slash.

     These correspond to the personal TeX macros.


File: auctex,  Node: Automatic Local,  Prev: Automatic Private,  Up: Automatic

Automatic Customization for a Directory
=======================================

   AUC TeX can update the style information about a file each time you
save it, and it will do this if the directory `TeX-auto-local' exist.
`TeX-auto-local' is by default set to `"auto/"', so simply creating an
`auto' directory will enable automatic saving of style information.

   The advantage of doing this is that macros, labels, etc. defined in
any file in a multifile document will be known in all the files in the
document.  The disadvantage is that saving will be slower.  To disable,
set `TeX-auto-local' to nil.

 - User Option: TeX-style-local
     Directory containing hand generated TeX information.  Must end
     with a slash.

     These correspond to TeX macros found in the current directory.

 - User Option: TeX-auto-local
     Directory containing automatically generated TeX information.
     Must end with a slash.

     These correspond to TeX macros found in the current directory.

A Simple Style File
===================

   Here is a simple example of a style file.

     ;;; book.el - Special code for book style.
     
     (TeX-add-style-hook "book"
      (function (lambda () (setq LaTeX-largest-level
                                 (LaTeX-section-level ("chapter"))))))

   This file specifies that the largest kind of section in a LaTeX
document using the book document style is chapter.  The interesting
thing to notice is that the style file defines an (anonymous) function,
and adds it to the list of loaded style hooks by calling
`TeX-add-style-hook'.

   The first time the user indirectly tries to access some style
specific information, such as the largest sectioning command available,
the style hooks for all files directly or indirectly read by the
current document is executed.  The actual files will only be evaluated
once, but the hooks will be called for each buffer using the style file.

 - Function: TeX-add-style-hook STYLE HOOK
     Add HOOK to the list of functions to run when we use the TeX file
     STYLE.


File: auctex,  Node: Adding Macros,  Next: Adding Environments,  Prev: Simple Style,  Up: Style Files

Adding Support for Macros
=========================

   The most common thing to define in a style hook is new symbols (TeX
macros).  Most likely along with a description of the arguments to the
function, since the symbol itself can be defined automatically.

   Here are a few examples from `latex.el'.

     (TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
      (function
       (lambda ()
          (TeX-add-symbols
          '("arabic" TeX-arg-counter)
          '("label" TeX-arg-define-label)
          '("ref" TeX-arg-label)
          '("newcommand" TeX-arg-define-macro [ "Number of arguments" ] t)
          '("newtheorem" TeX-arg-define-environment
            [ TeX-arg-environment "Numbered like" ]
            t [ TeX-arg-counter "Within counter" ])))))

 - Function: TeX-add-symbols SYMBOL ...
     Add each SYMBOL to the list of known symbols.

   Each argument to `TeX-add-symbols' is a list describing one symbol.
The head of the list is the name of the symbol, the remaining elements
describe each argument.

   If there are no additional elements, the symbol will be inserted with
point inside braces.  Otherwise, each argument of this function should
match an argument of the TeX macro.  What is done depends on the
argument type.

   If a macro is defined multiple times, AUC TeX will chose the one with
the longest definition (i.e. the one with the most arguments).

   Thus, to overwrite
             '("tref" 1) ; one argument
   you can specify
             '("tref" TeX-arg-label ignore) ; two arguments

   `ignore' is a function that does not do anything, so when you insert
a `tref' you will be prompted for a label and no more.

`string'
     Use the string as a prompt to prompt for the argument.

`number'
     Insert that many braces, leave point inside the first.

`nil'
     Insert empty braces.

`t'
     Insert empty braces, leave point between the braces.

`other symbols'
     Call the symbol as a function.  You can define your own hook, or
     use one of the predefined argument hooks.

`list'
     If the car is a string, insert it as a prompt and the next element
     as initial input.  Otherwise, call the car of the list with the
     remaining elements as arguments.

`vector'
     Optional argument.  If it has more than one element, parse it as a
     list, otherwise parse the only element as above.  Use square
     brackets instead of curly braces, and is not inserted on empty user
     input.

   A lot of argument hooks have already been defined.  The first
argument to all hooks is a flag indicating if it is an optional
argument.  It is up to the hook to determine what to do with the
remaining arguments, if any.  Typically the next argument is used to
overwrite the default prompt.

`TeX-arg-conditional'
     Implements if EXPR THEN ELSE.  If EXPR evaluates to true, parse
     THEN as an argument list, else parse ELSE as an argument list.

`TeX-arg-literal'
     Insert its arguments into the buffer.  Used for specifying extra
     syntax for a macro.

`TeX-arg-free'
     Parse its arguments but use no braces when they are inserted.

`TeX-arg-eval'
     Evaluate arguments and insert the result in the buffer.

`TeX-arg-file'
     Prompt for a tex or sty filename, and use it without the
     extension. Run the file hooks defined for it.

`TeX-arg-label'
     Prompt for a label completing with known labels.

`TeX-arg-macro'
     Prompt for a TeX macro with completion.

`TeX-arg-environment'
     Prompt for a LaTeX environment with completion.

`TeX-arg-cite'
     Prompt for a BibTeX citation.

`TeX-arg-counter'
     Prompt for a LaTeX counter.

`TeX-arg-savebox'
     Prompt for a LaTeX savebox.

`TeX-arg-file'
     Prompt for a filename in the current directory, and use it without
     the extension.

`TeX-arg-input-file'
     Prompt for a filename in the current directory, and use it without
     the extension.  Run the style hooks for the file.

`TeX-arg-define-label'
     Prompt for a label completing with known labels.  Add label to
     list of defined labels.

`TeX-arg-define-macro'
     Prompt for a TeX macro with completion.  Add macro to list of
     defined macros.

`TeX-arg-define-environment'
     Prompt for a LaTeX environment with completion.  Add environment to
     list of defined environments.

`TeX-arg-define-cite'
     Prompt for a BibTeX citation.

`TeX-arg-define-counter'
     Prompt for a LaTeX counter.

`TeX-arg-define-savebox'
     Prompt for a LaTeX savebox.

`TeX-arg-corner'
     Prompt for a LaTeX side or corner position with completion.

`TeX-arg-lr'
     Prompt for a LaTeX side with completion.

`TeX-arg-tb'
     Prompt for a LaTeX side with completion.

`TeX-arg-pagestyle'
     Prompt for a LaTeX pagestyle with completion.

`TeX-arg-verb'
     Prompt for delimiter and text.

`TeX-arg-pair'
     Insert a pair of numbers, use arguments for prompt. The numbers are
     surrounded by parentheses and separated with a comma.

`TeX-arg-size'
     Insert width and height as a pair.  No arguments.

`TeX-arg-coordinate'
     Insert x and y coordinates as a pair.  No arguments.

   If you add new hooks, you can assume that point is placed directly
after the previous argument, or after the macro name if this is the
first argument.  Please leave point located after the argument you are
inserting.  If you want point to be located somewhere else after all
hooks have been processed, set the value of `exit-mark'.  It will point
nowhere, until the argument hook sets it.

Adding Support for Environments
===============================

   Adding support for environments is very much like adding support for
TeX macros, except that each environment normally only takes one
argument, an environment hook.  The example is again a short version of
`latex.el'.

     (TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
      (function
       (lambda ()
         (LaTeX-add-environments
          '("document" LaTeX-env-document)
          '("enumerate" LaTeX-env-item)
          '("itemize" LaTeX-env-item)
          '("list" LaTeX-env-list)))))

   The only hook that is generally useful is `LaTeX-env-item', which is
used for environments that contain items.  It is completely up to the
environment hook to insert the environment, but the function
`LaTeX-insert-environment' may be of some help.  The hook will be
called with the name of the environment as its first argument, and extra
arguments can be provided by adding them to a list after the hook.

   For simple environments with arguments, for example defined with
`\newenvironment', you can make AUC TeX prompt for the arguments by
giving the prompt strings in the call to `LaTeX-add-environments'.  For
example, if you have defined a `loop' environment with the three
arguments FROM, TO, and STEP, you can add support for them in a style
file.

     %% loop.sty
     
     \newenvironment{loop}[3]{...}{...}

     ;; loop.el
     
     (TeX-add-style-hook "loop"
      (function
       (lambda ()
         (LaTeX-add-environments
          '("loop" "From" "To" "Step")))))

   If an environment is defined multiple times, AUC TeX will chose the
one with the longest definition.  Thus, if you have an enumerate style
file, and want it to replace the standard LaTeX enumerate hook above,
you could define an `enumerate.el' file as follows, and place it in the
appropriate style directory.

     (TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
      (function
       (lambda ()
         (LaTeX-add-environments
          '("enumerate" LaTeX-env-enumerate foo)))))
     
     (defun LaTeX-env-enumerate (environment &optional ignore) ...)

   The symbol `foo' will be passed to `LaTeX-env-enumerate' as the
second argument, but since we only added it to overwrite the definition
in `latex.el' it is just ignored.

 - Function: LaTeX-add-environments ENV ...
     Add each ENV to list of loaded environments.

 - Function: LaTeX-insert-environment ENV [ EXTRA ]
     Insert environment of type ENV, with optional argument EXTRA.

Adding Other Information
========================

   You can also specify bibliographical databases and labels in the
style file.  This is probably of little use, since this information will
usually be automatically generated from the TeX file anyway.

 - Function: LaTeX-add-bibliographies BIBLIOGRAPHY ...
     Add each BIBLIOGRAPHY to list of loaded bibliographies.

 - Function: LaTeX-add-labels LABEL ...
     Add each LABEL to the list of known labels.


File: auctex,  Node: Hacking the Parser,  Prev: Adding Other,  Up: Style Files

Automatic Extraction of New Things
==================================

   The automatic TeX information extractor works by searching for
regular expressions in the TeX files, and storing the matched
information.  You can add support for new constructs to the parser,
something that is needed when you add new commands to define symbols.

   For example, in the file `macro.tex' I define the following macro.

     \newcommand{\newmacro}[5]{%
     \def#1{#3\index{#4@#5~cite{#4}}\nocite{#4}}%
     \def#2{#5\index{#4@#5~cite{#4}}\nocite{#4}}%
     }

   AUC TeX will automatically figure out that `newmacro' is a macro
that takes five arguments.  However, it is not smart enough to
automatically see that each time we use the macro, two new macros are
defined.  We can specify this information in a style hook file.

     ;;; macro.el - Special code for my own macro file.

   When this file is first loaded, it adds a new entry to
`TeX-newmacro-regexp', and defines a function to be called before the
parsing starts, and one to be called after the parsing is done.  It
also declares a variable to contain the data collected during parsing.
Finally, it adds a style hook which describes the `newmacro' macro, as
we have seen it before.

   So the general strategy is: Add a new entry to `TeX-newmacro-regexp'.
Declare a variable to contain intermediate data during parsing.  Add
hook to be called before and after parsing.  In this case, the hook
before parsing just initializes the variable, and the hook after parsing
collects the data from the variable, and adds them to the list of
symbols found.

 - Variable: TeX-auto-regexp-list
     List of regular expressions matching TeX macro definitions.

     The list has the following format ((REGEXP MATCH TABLE) ...), that
     is, each entry is a list with three elements.

     REGEXP.  Regular expression matching the macro we want to parse.

     MATCH.  A number or list of numbers, each representing one
     parenthesized subexpression matched by REGEXP.

     TABLE.  The symbol table to store the data.  This can be a
     function, in which case the function is called with the argument
     MATCH.  Use `TeX-match-buffer' to get match data.  If it is not a
     function, it is presumed to be the name of a variable containing a
     list of match data.  The matched data (a string if MATCH is a
     number, a list of strings if MATCH is a list of numbers) is put in
     front of the table.

 - Variable: TeX-auto-prepare-hook nil
     List of functions to be called before parsing a TeX file.

 - Variable: TeX-auto-cleanup-hook nil
     List of functions to be called after parsing a TeX file.

Installation of AUC TeX
***********************

Compiling
=========

   The following describes how to install AUC TeX under Unix.  You may
also be able to do use these instructions under some other operating
systems, if you have already installed the proper GNU tools, such as
`make'.

   To install AUC TeX for an entire site (which may just be your own
personal Linux box), issue the following two commands as root:

     make
     make lispdir=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp install

   except that instead of /usr/local/... you should use the location of
your sites emacs installation.  AUC TeX will then be installed in a
subdirectory named `auctex' of the `site-lisp' directory, and the file
`tex-site.el' will be stored directly in the `site-lisp'.  You can now
tell your users to enable AUC TeX by adding

     (require 'tex-site)

   to their `.emacs' file.

   If you use xemacs instead, or if your emacs binary is named something
else than `emacs', specify this by using the commands

     make EMACS=xemacs
     make lispdir=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp install

   to install.

   If you want to install AUC TeX in your personal account, you should
chose a directory for all your emacs add-ons, for example an `elisp'
subdirectory in your home directory.  You can then install AUC TeX with
the commands

     make
     make lispdir=$HOME/elisp install

   You will then need to add the following lines to your `.emacs' file:

     (setq load-path (cons "~/elisp" load-path))
     (require 'tex-site)

Customizing
===========

   Next, you should edit the file `tex-site.el' to fit your local site.
You do this by looking at the customization section in the beginning
of `tex.el' and copy the definitions that are wrong for your site to
`tex-site.el'.  Do _not_ edit `tex.el' directly, or you will have to do
all the work over again when you upgrade AUC TeX.  AUC TeX will not
overwrite your old `tex-site.el' file next time you install, so you
will be able to keep all your customizations.

   There are two variables with a special significance.

 - User Option: TeX-lisp-directory
     The directory where you want to install the AUC TeX lisp files.

   This variable is set automatically by the `make install' command.
If you don't issue a `make install', for example if you don't want to
install AUC TeX in a different place, you will have to set this
variable manually to the location of the compiled files.

 - User Option: TeX-macro-global
     Directories containing the site's TeX style files.

   Normally, AUC TeX will only allow you to complete a short list of
built-in macros and environments and on the macros you define yourself.
If you issue the `M-x TeX-auto-generate-global' command after loading
AUC TeX, you will be able to complete on all macros available in the
standard style files used by your document.  To do this, you must set
this variable to a list of directories where the standard style files
are located.  The directories will be searched recursively, so there is
no reason to list subsirectories explicitly.

   You probably also need to change `TeX-command-list' to make sure
that the commands used for starting TeX, printing, etc. work on your
system.  Copy the definition from `tex.el' to `tex-site.el' and edit
the command names appropriately.

   Finally, copy and edit `TeX-printer-list' to contain the printers
available at your site.

   To extract information from your sites TeX macros, type `M-x
TeX-auto-generate-global' in your emacs.  This will only work if you
have set `TeX-macro-global' correctly in `tex-site.el'.

Contributed files
=================

   There are several files that are not part of AUC TeX proper, but
included in the distribution in case they are useful.

`hilit-LaTeX.el'
     Better highlighting for the obsolete `hilit19' package.

`bib-cite.el'
     Better support for bibliographies and much more.

`tex-jp.el'
     Support for Japanese.

   Read the comments in the start of each file for more information
about how to install, what they do, and who wrote and maintains them.

Wishlist
********

   This is a list of projects for AUC TeX.  Bug reports and requests we
can not fix or honor right away will be added to this list.  If you have
some time for emacs lisp hacking, you are encouraged to try to provide a
solution to one of the following problems.  It might be a good idea to
mail me first, though.

   * Page count when compiling should (optionally) go to modeline of the
     window where the compilation command was invoked, instead of the
     output window.  Suggested by Karsten Tinnefeld
     <tinnefeld@irb.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.

   * Command to insert a macrodefinition in the preamble, without moving
     point from the current location.  Suggested by "Jeffrey C. Ely"
     <ely@nwu.edu>.

   * Filling messes up comments, but only at the end of the file.
     Reported by Juergen Reiss <psy3022@rzbox.uni-wuerzburg.de>.

   * `C-c C-q C-e' doesn't work properly on nested itemize environments.
     Reported by  "Robert B. Love"  <rlove@raptor.rmNUG.ORG>.

   * One suggestion for AUC-TeX: I think that the font command C-c C-f
     C-r, which produces \textrm{} in a LaTeX file, should instead
     produce either \textrm{} or \mathrm{}, depending on whether one is
     in math mode or not. -- John Palmieri <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

   * A way to add and overwrite math mode entries in style files, and to
     decide where they should be.  Suggested by Remo Badii
     <Remo.Badii@psi.ch>.

   * Create template for (first) line of tabular environment.

   * I think prompting for the master is the intended behaviour.  It
     corresponds to a `shared' value for TeX-master.

     There should probably be a `none' value which wouldn't query for
     the master, but instead disable all features that relies on
     TeX-master.

     This default value for TeX-master could then be controled with
     mapping based on the extension.

   * `C-c '' should alway stay in the current window, also when it find
     a new file.

   * `LaTeX-fill-environment' does not indent the closing `\end'.

   * Rewrite `ltx-help.el' and put it in `latex.el'.  Fix also:
          From: Denby Wong <DnB@slip224.qlink.QueensU.CA>
          
           1) change documentation regarding where to get the
              latest version (at CTAN at pip.shsu.edu for me)
              under info/latex2e-help-texinfo/
          
           2) change or provide choice over which version to
              use.  There are three references to the info
              node "(latex)" in the file which should be
              "(latex2e)"  for the new file.
          
          From: Piet van Oostrum <piet@cs.ruu.nl>
          
          One of the annoying things of latex-help is that if you ask for \LARGE, you
          get \large if you have case-fold-search=t. This is really info's problem as
          it doesn't reset it for a search of the node, but it would be easy to stick
          a (let (case-fold-search) in latex-help.

   * It should be possible to insert a default preamble containing e.g.
     `usepackage' declarations, perhaps depending on the document class.

   * Multiple argument completion for `\bibliography'.  In general, I
     ought to make `,' special for these kind of completions.

   * Do not overwrite emacs warnings about existing auto-save files when
     loading a new file.

   * Suggest `makindex' when appropriate.

   * Maybe the regexp for matching a TeX symbol during parsing should be
     `"\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\|.\\)"' --
     `<thiemann@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>' Peter Thiemann.

   * AUC TeX should be able to parse LaTeX2e `.cls' files.  Here are
     the regexps by `<thiemann@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>' Peter
     Thiemann.

               ("\\\\DeclareRobustCommand{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?\\[\\([0-9]+\\)\\]\
          \\[\\([^\]\\\\\n\r]+\\)\\]"
                (1 2 3) LaTeX-auto-optional)
               ("\\\\DeclareRobustCommand{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?\\[\\([0-9]+\\)\\]"
                (1 2) LaTeX-auto-arguments)
               ("\\\\DeclareRobustCommand{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?" 1 TeX-auto-symbol)
               ("\\\\DeclareFixedFont{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?"
                1 TeX-auto-symbol)
               ("\\\\Declare\\(Text\\|Old\\)FontCommand{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?"
                2 TeX-auto-symbol)
               ("\\\\DeclareMath\\(Symbol\\|Delimiter\\|Accent\\|Radical\\){?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?"
                2 TeX-auto-symbol)
               ;;; it is also valid to declare just a single symbol, e.g. <,
               ;;; with \DeclareMathSymbol but it is not necessary to register that here
               ("\\\\DeclareText\\(Command\\|Symbol\\|Accent\\|Composite\\){?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}?"
                2 TeX-auto-symbol)

   * Use index files (when available) to speed up `C-c C-m include
     <RET>'.

   * Option not to calculate very slow completions like for `C-c C-m
     include <RET>'.

   * AUC TeX should not parse verbatim environments.

   * Font menu should be created from `TeX-font-list'.

   * Installation procedure written purely in emacs lisp.

   * Format LaTeX comment blocks.

   * Included PostScript files should also be counted as part of the
     document.

   * The argument to `\verb' may be broken when filling if it contains a
     space.  This should be fixed or documented.  Suggested by several
     people.

   * The parser should catch warnings about undefined crossreferences.
     Suggested by Richard Hirsch `i3080501@ws.rz.tu-bs.de'.

   * A nice hierarchical by-topic organization of all officially
     documented LaTeX macros, available from the menu bar.

   * Make ``' check for math context in `LaTeX-math-mode'. and simply
     self insert if not in a math context.

   * Make `TeX-insert-dollar' more robust.  Currently it can be fooled
     by `\mbox''es and escaped double dollar for example.

   * LaTeX formatting should skip `verbatim' environments.

   * `TeX-command-default' should be set from the master file, if not
     set locally.  Suggested by Peter Whaite `<peta@cim.mcgill.ca>'.

   * Make AUC TeX work with `crypt++'.  Suggested by Chris Moore
     `<Chris.Moore@src.bae.co.uk>'.

   * Fix bug with `TeX-show-environment' from hidden document
     environment.

   * Function to check if you are in math mode (between two dollar
     signs).  Suggested by Jan Erik Odegard `<odegard@dsp.rice.edu>'

   * The `Spell' command should apply to all files in a document.  Maybe
     it could try to restrict to files that have been modified since
     last spell check?  Suggested by Ravinder Bhumbla
     `<rbhumbla@ucsd.edu>'.

   * Make <.> check for abbreviations and sentences ending with capital
     letters.

   * Use Emacs 19 minibuffer history to choose between previewers, and
     other stuff.  Suggested by John Interrante
     `<interran@uluru.Stanford.EDU>'.

   * Make features.

     A new command `TeX-update' (`C-c C-u') could be used to create an
     up-to-date dvi file by repeatedly running BibTeX, MakeIndex and
     (La)TeX, until an error occurs or we are done.

     An alternative is to have an `Update' command that ensures the
     `dvi' file is up to date.  This could be called before printing and
     previewing.

   * Documentation of variables that can be set in a style hook.

     We need a list of what can safely be done in an ordinary style
     hook.  You can not set a variable that AUC TeX depends on, unless
     AUC TeX knows that it has to run the style hooks first.

     Here is the start of such a list.
    `LaTeX-add-environments'

    `TeX-add-symbols'

    `LaTeX-add-labels'

    `LaTeX-add-bibliographies'

    `LaTeX-largest-level'
   * Correct indentation for tabular, tabbing, table, math, and array
     environments.

   * Optional special indentation after an `\item'.

          \begin{itemize}
          \item blabalaskdfjlas lajf adf
                lkfjl  af jasl lkf jlsdf jlf
          \item f lk jldjf lajflkas flf af
          \end{itemize}

   * Completion for counters and sboxes.

   * Outline should be (better) supported in TeX mode.

     At least, support headers, trailers, as well as TeX-outline-extra.

   * `TeX-header-start' and `TeX-trailer-end'.

     We might want these, just for fun (and outlines)

   * Plain TeX and LaTeX specific header and trailer expressions.

     We should have a way to globally specify the default value of the
     header and trailer regexps.

   * Add support for original `TeX-mode' keybindings.

     A third initialization file (`tex-mode.el') containing an emulator
     of the standard `TeX-mode' would help convince some people to
     change to AUC TeX.

   * Make `TeX-next-error' parse ahead and store the results in a list,
     using markers to remember buffer positions in order to be more
     robust with regard to line numbers and changed files.  This is what
     `next-error' does. (Or did, until Emacs 19).

   * When `LaTeX-environment' is given an argument, change the current
     environment.  Be smart about `\item[]' versus `\item ' and labels
     like `fig:' versus `tab:'.

   * Check out if lightning completion from Ultra TeX is anything for
     us.

   * Finish the TeXinfo mode.  For one thing, many TeXinfo mode
     commands do not accept braces around their arguments.

   * BibTeX mode.

   * Support for AMSLaTeX style files.

   * Hook up the letter environment with `bbdb.el'.

   * Make the letter environment hook produce `documentstyle' too.
