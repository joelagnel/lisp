@top AUC @TeX{}
 
AUC @TeX{} is an integrated environment for editing La@TeX{} and
@TeX{} files.@refill

This file almost documents AUC @TeX{} version 12.

Although AUC @TeX{} contains a large number of features, there are no
reasons to despair.  You can continue to write @TeX{} and La@TeX{}
documents the way you are used to, and only start using the multiple
features in small steps.  AUC @TeX{} is not monolithic, each feature
described in this manual is useful by itself, but together they provide
an environment where you will make very few LaTeX errors, and makes it
easy to find the errors that may slip through anyway.

If you want to make AUC TeX aware of style files and multi-file
documents right away, insert the following in your @file{.emacs} file.
@lisp
(setq TeX-auto-save t)
(setq TeX-parse-self t)
(setq-default TeX-master nil)
@end lisp

NOTE: This documentation is preliminary.  It should however cover most
important points.  Corrections or perhaps rewrites of sections
are VERY WELCOME.@refill

The most commonly used commands/macros of AUC @TeX{} are those which
simply insert templates for often used @TeX{} and/or La@TeX{}
constructs, like font changes, handling of environments, etc.
These features are very simple, and easy to learn, and help you
avoid stupid mistakes like mismatched braces, or
@samp{\begin@{@}}-@samp{\end@{@}} pairs.@refill

@cindex Quotes
@cindex Double quotes
@cindex Braces
@cindex Brackets
@cindex Dollars
@cindex Math mode delimiters
@cindex Matching dollar signs
@cindex Display math mode

In @TeX{}, literal double quotes @samp{"like this"} are seldom used,
instead two single quotes are used @samp{``like this''}.  To help you
insert these efficiently, AUC @TeX{} allows you to continue to press
@kbd{"} to insert two single quotes.  To get a literal double quote,
press @kbd{"} twice.

@deffn Command TeX-insert-quote @var{count}
@kindex "
(@kbd{"}) Insert the appropriate quote marks for TeX.  

Inserts the value of @code{TeX-open-quote} (normally @samp{``}) or
@code{TeX-close-quote} (normally @samp{''}) depending on the context.
With prefix argument, always inserts @samp{"} characters.@refill
@end deffn

@defopt TeX-open-quote
String inserted by typing @kbd{"} to open a quotation.
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-close-quote
String inserted by typing @kbd{"} to close a quotation.
@end defopt

If you include the style file @file{german} @code{TeX-open-quote} and
@code{TeX-close-quote} will both be set to @samp{"}.

In AUC @TeX{}, dollar signs should match like they do in @TeX{}.  This
has been partially implemented, we assume dollar signs always match
within a paragraph.  The first @samp{$} you insert in a paragraph will
do nothing special.  The second @samp{$} will match the first.  This
will be indicated by moving the cursor temporarily over the first dollar
sign.  If you enter a dollar sign that matches a double dollar sign
@samp{$$} AUC @TeX{} will automatically insert two dollar signs.  If you
enter a second dollar sign that matches a single dollar sign, the single
dollar sign will automatically be converted to a double dollar sign.

@deffn Command TeX-insert-dollar @var{arg}
@kindex $
(@kbd{$}) Insert dollar sign.  

Show matching dollar sign if this dollar sign end the @TeX{} math mode.  
Ensure double dollar signs match up correctly by inserting extra
dollar signs when needed.

With optional @var{arg}, insert that many dollar signs.
@end deffn

To avoid unbalanced braces, it is useful to insert them pairwise.  You
can do this by typing @kbd{C-c @{}.

@deffn Command TeX-insert-braces
@kindex C-c @{
(@kbd{C-c @{}) Make a pair of braces and position the cursor
to type inside of them.
@end deffn

@cindex Fonts
@cindex Font macros
@cindex Changing font
@cindex Specifying a font

Perhaps the most used keyboard commands of AUC @TeX{} are the short-cuts
available for easy insertion of font changing macros.  They all put the
font change inside a @TeX{} group, a practice that help preventing
subtle errors.  The most significant advantage of using these command
instead of typing it in yourself, is that the braces will always match
correctly.  

If you give an argument (that is, type @kbd{C-u}) to the font command,
the innermost font will be replaced, i.e. the font in the @TeX{} group
around point will be changed.  The following table shows the available
commands, with @code{@point{}} indicating the position where the text
will be inserted.@refill

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-f C-r 
@kindex C-c C-f C-r
@cindex @code{\textrm}

@item C-c C-f C-d
@kindex C-c C-f C-c
@cindex Deleting fonts
Delete the innermost font specification containing point.

@end table

@deffn Command TeX-font @var{arg}
@kindex C-c C-f
(@kbd{C-c C-f}) Insert template for font change command.

If @var{replace} is not nil, replace current font.  @var{what}
determines the font to use, as specified by @code{TeX-font-list}.
@end deffn

@defopt TeX-font-list
List of fonts used by TeX-font.

Each entry is a list with three elements.  The first element is the
key to activate the font.  The second element is the string to insert
before point, and the third element is the string to insert after
point.  An optional fourth element means always replace if not nil.

Insertion of sectioning macros, that is @samp{\chapter},
@samp{\section}, @samp{\subsection}, etc. and accompanying
@samp{\label}'s may be eased by using @kbd{C-c C-s}.  This command is
highly customizable, the following describes the default behavior.

When invoking you will be asked for a section macro to insert.  An
appropriate default is automatically selected by AUC @TeX{}, that is
either: at the top of the document; the top level sectioning for that
document style, and any other place: The same as the last occurring
sectioning command.

Next, you will be asked for the actual name of that section, and
last you will be asked for a label to be associated with that section.
The label will be prefixed by the value specified in
@code{LaTeX-section-hook}.

@deffn Command LaTeX-section @var{arg}
@kindex C-c C-s
(@kbd{C-c C-s}) Insert a sectioning command.

Determine the type of section to be inserted, by the argument
@var{arg}.@refill

@itemize @bullet
@item
If @var{arg} is nil or missing, use the current level.
@item
If @var{arg} is a list (selected by C-u), go downward one level.
@item
If @var{arg} is negative, go up that many levels.
@item
If @var{arg} is positive or zero, use absolute level:
@itemize +

@end itemize
@end itemize

The following variables can be set to customize the function.

@vtable @code
@item LaTeX-section-hook
Hooks to be run when inserting a section.
@item LaTeX-section-label       
Prefix to all section references.
@end vtable

@end deffn

The precise behavior of @code{LaTeX-section} is defined by the contents
of @code{LaTeX-section-hook}.

@defopt LaTeX-section-hook
List of hooks to run when a new section is inserted.

The following variables are set before the hooks are run

@table @var
@item level
Numeric section level, default set by prefix arg to @code{LaTeX-section}.
@item name
Name of the sectioning command, derived from @var{level}.
@item title
The title of the section, default to an empty string.
@item toc
Entry for the table of contents list, default nil.  
@item done-mark
Position of point afterwards, default nil meaning after the inserted
text.
@end table

A number of hooks are already defined.  Most likely, you will be able to
get the desired functionality by choosing from these hooks.

@ftable @code
@item LaTeX-section-heading
Query the user about the name of the sectioning command.  Modifies
@var{level} and @var{name}.
@item LaTeX-section-title
Query the user about the title of the section. Modifies @var{title}.
@item LaTeX-section-toc
Query the user for the toc entry.  Modifies @var{toc}.
@item LaTeX-section-section
Insert La@TeX{} section command according to @var{name}, @var{title},
and @var{toc}.  If @var{toc} is nil, no toc entry is inserted.  If
@var{toc} or @var{title} are empty strings, @var{done-mark} will be
placed at the point they should be inserted.
@item LaTeX-section-label
Insert a label after the section command.  Controlled by the variable
@code{LaTeX-section-label}.
@end ftable 

To get a full featured @code{LaTeX-section} command, insert

@end lisp

in your @file{.emacs} file.
@end defopt

The behavior of @code{LaTeX-section-label} is determined by the
variable @code{LaTeX-section-label}.@refill

@defopt LaTeX-section-label
Default prefix when asking for a label.

If it is a string, it is used unchanged for all kinds of sections. 
If it is nil, no label is inserted.
If it is a list, the list is searched for a member whose car is equal
to the name of the sectioning command being inserted.  The cdr is then
used as the prefix.  If the name is not found, or if the cdr is nil,
no label is inserted.

@cindex Prefix for labels
@cindex Label prefix
@cindex Labels
By default, chapters have a prefix of @samp{cha:} while sections and
subsections have a prefix of @samp{sec:}.  Labels are not automatically
inserted for other types of sections.

@node Environments,  , Sectioning, Frequently Used Commands
@section Inserting Environment Templates
@cindex Environments
@cindex @samp{\begin}
@cindex @samp{\end}

A large apparatus is available that supports insertions of environments,
that is @samp{\begin@{@}} --- @samp{\end@{@}} pairs.

AUC @TeX{} is aware of most of the actual environments available in a
specific document.  This is achieved by examining your
@samp{\documentclass} command, and consulting a precompiled list of
environments available in a large number of styles.

You insert an environment with @kbd{C-c C-e}, and select an environment
type.  Depending on the environment, AUC @TeX{} may ask more questions
about the optional parts of the selected environment type.  With
@kbd{C-u C-c C-e} you will change the current environment.

@deffn Command LaTeX-environment @var{arg}
@kindex C-c C-e
(@kbd{C-c C-e})  AUC @TeX{} will prompt you for an environment
to insert.  At this prompt, you may press @key{TAB} or @key{SPC} to
complete a partially written name, and/or to get a list of available
environments.  After selection of a specific environment AUC @TeX{} may
prompt you for further specifications.  

If the optional argument @var{arg} is not-nil (i.e. you have given a
prefix argument), the current environment is modified and no new
environment is inserted.
@end deffn

As a default selection, AUC @TeX{} will suggest the environment last
inserted or, as the first choice the value of the variable
@code{LaTeX-default-environment}.

@defopt LaTeX-default-environment
Default environment to insert when invoking @samp{LaTeX-environment}
first time.
@end defopt

If the document is empty, or the cursor is placed at the top of the
document, AUC @TeX{} will default to insert a `document' environment.

Most of these are described further in the following sections, and you
may easily specify more, as described in `Customizing environments'.

You can close the current environment with @kbd{C-c ]}, but we suggest
that you use @kbd{C-c C-e} to insert complete environments instead.

described above, you will be prompted for a number of additional things.

@table @var
@item float-to
This field is the option of float environments that controls how they are
placed in the final document.  In La@TeX{} this is a sequence of the

@section Entering Mathematics 
@cindex Mathematics
@cindex Symbols
@cindex Abbreviations

@TeX{} is written by a mathematician, and has always contained good
support for formatting mathematical text.  AUC @TeX{} supports this
tradition, by offering a special minor mode for entering text with many
mathematical symbols.  You can enter this mode by typing @kbd{C-c
~}.@refill

@deffn Command LaTeX-math-mode
@kindex C-c ~
(@kbd{C-c ~}) Toggle LaTeX-math-mode.  This is a minor mode rebinding
the key @code{LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix} to allow easy typing of
mathematical symbols.  @kbd{`} will read a character from the keyboard,
and insert the symbol as specified in @code{LaTeX-math-list}.  If given a
prefix argument, the symbol will be surrounded by dollar signs.@refill
@end deffn

You can use another prefix key (instead of @kbd{`}) by  setting the
variable LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix.

@defopt LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix
A string containing the prefix of @code{LaTeX-math-mode} commands;
This value defaults to @kbd{`}. @refill
@end defopt

The variable @code{LaTeX-math-list} holds the actual mapping.

@defopt LaTeX-math-list
A list containing key command mappings to use in @code{LaTeX-math-mode}.
The car of each element is the key and the cdr is the macro name. 
@end defopt

The AUC @TeX{} distributions includes a reference card for
@code{LaTeX-math-mode} with a list of all math mode commands.

@section Completion 
@cindex Completion 
@cindex Expansion
@cindex Macro expansion
@cindex Macro completion
@cindex Macro arguments
@cindex Arguments to @TeX{} macros

Emacs lisp programmers probably know the @code{lisp-complete-symbol}
command, usually bound to @kbd{M-@key{TAB}}.  Users of the wonderful
ispell mode know and love the @code{ispell-complete-word} command from
that package.  Similarly, AUC @TeX{} has a @code{TeX-complete-symbol}
command, usually bound to @kbd{M-@key{TAB}}.  Using
@code{LaTeX-complete-symbol} makes it easier to type and remember the
names of long La@TeX{} macros.
 
In order to use @code{TeX-complete-symbol}, you should write a backslash
and the start of the macro.  Typing @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} will now
complete as much of the macro, as it unambiguously can.  For example, if
you type `@samp{\renewc}' and then `@kbd{M-@key{TAB}}, it will expand
to `@samp{\renewcommand}'.
 
@deffn Command TeX-complete-symbol
@kindex M-@key{TAB}
(@kbd{M-@key{TAB}})  Complete @TeX{} symbol before point.
@end deffn

A more direct way to insert a macro is with @code{TeX-insert-macro},
bound to @kbd{C-c C-m}.  It has the advantage over completion that it
knows about the argument of most standard La@TeX{} macros, and will
prompt for them.  It also knows about the type of the arguments, so it
will for example give completion for the argument to @samp{\include}.
Some examples are listed below.

@deffn Command TeX-insert-macro
@kindex C-c C-m
(@kbd{C-c C-m}) Prompt (with completion) for the name of a @TeX{} macro,
and if AUC @TeX{} knows the macro, prompt for each argument.
@end deffn

As a default selection, AUC @TeX{} will suggest the macro last inserted
or, as the first choice the value of the variable
@code{TeX-default-macro}.

@defopt TeX-default-macro
Default macro to insert when invoking @code{TeX-insert-macro} first time.
@end defopt

A faster alternative is to bind the function @code{TeX-electric-macro}
to @samp{\}.  This can be done by setting the variable @code{TeX-electric-escape}

@defopt TeX-electric-escape
If this is non-nil when AUC @TeX{} is loaded, the @TeX{} escape
character @samp{\} will be bound to @code{TeX-electric-macro}
@end defopt

The difference between @code{TeX-insert-macro} and
@code{TeX-electric-macro} is that space will complete and exit from the
minibuffer in @code{TeX-electric-macro}.  Use @key{TAB} if you merely
want to complete.

@deffn Command TeX-electric-macro
Prompt (with completion) for the name of a @TeX{} macro,
and if AUC @TeX{} knows the macro, prompt for each argument.
Space will complete and exit.
@end deffn

By default AUC @TeX{} will put an empty set braces @samp{@{@}} after a
macro with no arguments to stop it from eating the next whitespace.
This can be stopped by entering @code{LaTeX-math-mode},
@pxref{Mathematics}, or by setting @code{TeX-insert-braces} to nil

@defopt TeX-insert-braces
If non-nil, append a empty pair of braces after inserting a macro.
@end defopt

Completions work because AUC @TeX{} can analyze @TeX{} files, and store
symbols in emacs lisp files for later retrieval.  @xref{Automatic}, for
more information.

@cindex \cite, completion of
@cindex Bib@TeX{}, completion
@cindex cite, completion of
@cindex bibliography, completion
@cindex citations, completion of
@cindex \label, completion
@cindex \ref, completion
@cindex labels, completion of
AUC @TeX{} will also make completion for many macro arguments, for
example existing labels when you enter a @samp{\ref} macro with
@code{TeX-insert-macro} or @code{TeX-electric-macro}, and Bib@TeX{}
entries when you enter a @samp{\cite} macro.  For this kind of
completion to work, parsing must be enabled as described in
@pxref{Parsing Files}.  For @samp{\cite} you must also make sure that
the Bib@TeX{} files have been saved at least once after you enabled
automatic parsing on save, and that the basename of the Bib@TeX{} file
does not conflict with the basename of one of @TeX{} files.

@section Commenting 

It is often necessary to comment out temporarily a region of @TeX{} or
La@TeX{} code.  This can be done with the commands @kbd{C-c ;} and
@kbd{C-c %}.  @kbd{C-c ;} will comment out all lines in the current
region, while @kbd{C-c %} will comment out the current paragraph.  To
uncomment, simply type @kbd{C-u - C-c ;} to uncomment all lines in the
region, or @kbd{C-u - C-c %} uncomment all comment lines around point.  

By default, these commands will insert or remove a single @samp{%}.  To
insert more than one, give an argument. @kbd{C-u 5 C-c %} will add five
@samp{%} to each line, while @kbd{C-u - 5 C-c %} will remove up to 5
@samp{%} from each line.

@deffn Command TeX-comment-region @var{count}
@kindex C-c ;
(@kbd{C-c ;}) Add or remove @samp{%} from the beginning of each line in
the current region, as specified by @var{count}.
@end deffn

@deffn Command TeX-comment-paragraph @var{count}
@kindex C-c %
(@kbd{C-c %}) Add or remove @samp{%} from the beginning of each line in
the current paragraph, as specified by @var{count}.  When removing
@samp{%}'s the paragraph is considered to consist of all preceding and
succeeding lines starting with a @samp{%}, until the first non-comment

@section Marking, Formatting and Indenting
@cindex Formatting
@cindex Filling
@cindex Indenting
@cindex Reformatting
@cindex Reindenting

AUC @TeX{} contains very advanced handling of indentation and
reformatting of the La@TeX{} source.  If you have already tried AUC
@TeX{} with @code{auto-fill-mode} enabled, you may have noted that the
source is automatically indented and formatted as you write it.  More
over, AUC @TeX{} is able to format sections of text on demand.

It is important to realize, that AUC @TeX{} comes with `formatting' in
two fashions.  Either letting @TeX{} format the file, or letting AUC
@TeX{} make the ASCII document look better.

Indentation is done by La@TeX{} environments and by @TeX{} groups, that
is the body of an environment is indented by the value of
@code{LaTeX-indent-level} (default 2).  Also, items of an `itemize-like'
environment are indented by the value of @code{LaTeX-item-indent},
default @minus{}2.  This indentation makes it easier to see the
structure of the document, and to catch errors such as a missing close
brace.  Thus, the indentation is done for precisely the same reasons
that you would indent ordinary computer programs.
@vindex LaTeX-indent-level
@vindex LaTeX-item-indent

The following is a short sample of an itemize environment indented by
AUC @TeX{}.  If more environments are nested, they are indented
`accumulated' just like most programming languages usually are seen
indented in nested constructs.

@example
\begin@{itemize@}
\item Insertion of templates for logical-structural compositions such as
  environments and sections.
\item Hot-keys for easy access to certain often used constructs, e.g.,
  font changes, accented letters, and mathematical symbols.
\item Running application programs (such as \TeX), and then parsing
  the output so that errors in the document may be located 
  easily.
\item Support for multi-file documents.
\item Online help for \AllTeX\ error messages.
\item Outlining\Dash i.e., manipulating the document as a composition
  of nested/sequential logical constructs.
\item Instant formatting and indentation of the \ascii-document in
  order to make it easier to read.
\item `Completion' (and thereby spell-checking) of partially written
  control sequences.
\end@{itemize@}
@end example

You can format and indent single lines, paragraphs, environments, or
sections.

@table @kbd
@item @key{TAB}
@kindex @key{TAB}
@findex LaTeX-indent-line
@code{LaTeX-indent-line} will indent the current line.

@item @key{LFD}
@kindex @key{LFD}
@code{reindent-then-newline-and-indent} indents the current line, and
then inserts a new line (much like @key{RET}) and move the cursor to an
appropriate position by the left margin.

@item M-q
@kindex M-q
Alias for @kbd{C-c C-q C-p}

@item C-c C-q C-p
@kindex C-c C-q C-p
@findex LaTeX-fill-paragraph
@code{LaTeX-fill-paragraph} will reformat or `fill' the current
paragraph.

@item C-c C-q C-e
@kindex C-c C-q C-e
@findex LaTeX-fill-environment
@code{LaTeX-fill-environment} will reformat or `fill' the current
environment.  This may e.g. be the `document' environment, in which case
the entire document will be formatted.

@item C-c C-q C-s
@kindex C-c C-q C-s
@findex LaTeX-fill-section
@code{LaTeX-fill-section} will reformat or `fill' the current
logical sectional unit.

@item C-c C-q C-r
@kindex C-c C-q C-r

them.

AUC @TeX{} supports the standard outline minor mode using La@TeX{}
sectioning commands as header lines.  @xref{Outline Mode, , Outline
Mode, emacs, GNU Emacs Manual}.  By default
@code{outline-minor-mode} will use the prefix key @kbd{C-c} which is
also used by AUC @TeX{}, so it is suggested that you choose another
prefix key by inserting 

@lisp
  (setq outline-minor-mode-prefix "\C-c\C-o") ; Or whatever...
@end lisp

in your @file{.emacs} file.

You can add your own headings by setting the variable
@code{TeX-outline-extra}. 

@defvar TeX-outline-extra
List of extra @TeX{} outline levels.

Each element is a list with two entries.  The first entry is the regular
expression matching a header, and the second is the level of the header.
A @samp{^} is automatically prepended to the regular expressions in the
list, so they must match text at the beginning of the line.

See @code{LaTeX-section-list} for existing header levels.
@end defvar

The following example add @samp{\item} and @samp{\bibliography} headers,
with @samp{\bibliography} at the same outline level as @samp{\section},
and @samp{\item} being below @samp{\subparagraph}.

@example
(setq TeX-outline-extra
      '(("[ \t]*\\\\\\(bib\\)?item\\b" 7)

@deffn Command TeX-command-region
@kindex C-c C-r
(@kbd{C-c C-r}) Query the user for a command, and run it on the ``region
file''.  Some commands (typically those invoking @TeX{} or La@TeX{})
will write the current region into the region file, after extracting the
header and tailer from the master file.  If mark is not active, use the
old region.  The name of the region file is controlled by the variable
@code{TeX-region}.  The name of the master file is controlled by the
variable @code{TeX-master}.  The header is all text up to the line
matching the regular expression @code{TeX-header-end}.  The trailer is
all text from the line matching the regular expression
@code{TeX-trailer-start}.  The available commands are controlled by the

for the region file to be active at the same time.  Thus, if you are
editing @var{n} different documents, you can have @var{n} plus one
processes running at the same time.  If the last process you started was
on the region, the commands described in @ref{Debugging} and
@ref{Control} will work on that process, otherwise they will work on the
process associated with the current document.

@defopt TeX-region
The name of the file for temporarily storing the text when formatting
the current region.
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-header-end

@defopt TeX-trailer-start
A regular expression matching the start of the trailer.  By default,
this is @samp{\end@{document@}} in La@TeX{} mode and @samp{\bye} in

@end defopt

AUC @TeX{} will try to guess what command you want to invoke, but by
default it will assume that you want to run @TeX{} in @TeX{} mode and
La@TeX{} in La@TeX{} mode.  You can overwrite this by setting the
variable @code{TeX-command-default}.

@defopt TeX-command-default

for all files by setting them in either @code{TeX-mode-hook},
@code{plain-TeX-mode-hook}, or @code{LaTeX-mode-hook}.  To overwrite

You may wish to spread a document over many files (as you are likely to do if
there are multiple authors, or if you have not yet discovered the power
of the outline commands (@pxref{Outline})).  This can be done by having a
``master'' file in which you include the various files with the @TeX{}
macro @samp{\input} or the La@TeX{} macro @samp{\include}.  These
files may also include other files themselves.  However, to format the
document you must run the commands on the top level master file.@refill

When you, for example, ask AUC @TeX{} to run a command on the master file,
it has no way of knowing the name of the master file.  By default,
it will assume that the current file is the master file.  If you insert
the following in your @file{.emacs} file AUC @TeX{} will use a more
advanced algorithm.

@lisp
(setq-default TeX-master nil) ; Query for master file.
@end lisp

If AUC @TeX{} finds the line indicating the end of the header in a
master file (@code{TeX-header-end}), it can figure out for itself that
this is a master file.  Otherwise, it will ask for the name of the
master file associated with the buffer.  To avoid asking you again, AUC
@TeX{} will automatically insert the name of the master file as a file
variable (@pxref{File Variables,,,emacs,The Emacs Editor}).  You can
also insert the file variable yourself, by putting the following text at
the end of your files.@refill
@findex TeX-header-end

@example
% Local Variables: 
% TeX-master: "master"
% End: 
@end example

You should always set this variable to the name of the top level document.  If
you always use the same name for your top level documents, you can set
@code{TeX-master} in your @file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
(setq-default TeX-master "master") ; All master files called "master".
@end lisp

@defopt TeX-master
The master file associated with the current buffer.  If the file being
edited is actually included from another file, then you can tell AUC @TeX{}
the name of the master file by setting this variable.  If there are
multiple levels of nesting, specify the top level file.@refill

If this variable is @code{nil}, AUC @TeX{} will query you for the
name.@refill

If the variable is @code{t}, then AUC @TeX{} will assume the file is a master
file itself.@refill

If the variable is @code{shared}, then AUC @TeX{} will query for the name,
but will not change the file.@refill

It is suggested that you use the File Variables (@pxref{File
Variables,,,emacs,The Emacs Editor}) to set this variable permanently
for each file.@refill
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-one-master
Regular expression matching ordinary TeX files.

You should set this variable to match the name of all files, for which
it is a good idea to append a @code{TeX-master} file variable entry
automatically.  When AUC @TeX{} adds the name of the master file as a
file variable, it does not need to ask next time you edit the file.

If you dislike AUC @TeX{} automatically modifying your files, you can
set this variable to @samp{"<none>"}.  By default, AUC @TeX{} will modify
any file with an extension of @samp{.tex}.@refill
@end defopt

AUC @TeX{} keeps track of macros, environments, labels, and style
files that are used in a given document.  For this to work with
multifile documents, AUC @TeX{} has to have a place to put the
information about the files in the document.  This is done by having an
@file{auto} subdirectory placed in the directory where your document is
located.  Each time you save a file, AUC @TeX{} will write information
about the file into the @file{auto} directory.  When you load a file,
AUC @TeX{} will read the information in the @file{auto} directory
about the file you loaded @emph{and the master file specified by
@code{TeX-master}}.  Since the master file (perhaps indirectly) includes
all other files in the document, AUC @TeX{} will get information from
all files in the document.  This means that you will get from each file,
for example, completion for all labels defined anywhere in the document.

AUC TeX will create the @file{auto} directory automatically if
@code{TeX-auto-save} is non-nil.  Without it, the files in the document
will not know anything about each other, except for the name of the
master file.  @xref{Automatic Local}.

@chapter Automatic Parsing of @TeX{} files.
@cindex Parsing @TeX{}
@cindex Automatic Parsing
@cindex Tabs
@cindex Tabify
@cindex Untabify

AUC @TeX{} depends heavily on being able to extract information from the
buffers by parsing them.  Since parsing the buffer can be somewhat slow,
the parsing is initially disabled.  You are encouraged to enable them by
adding the following lines to your @file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
(setq TeX-parse-self t) ; Enable parse on load.
(setq TeX-auto-save t) ; Enable parse on save.
@end lisp

The later command will make AUC @TeX{} store the parsed information in
an @file{auto} subdirectory in the directory each time the @TeX{} files
are stored, @pxref{Automatic Local}.  If AUC @TeX{} finds the pre-parsed
information when loading a file, it will not need to reparse the buffer.
The information in the @file{auto} directory is also useful for
multifile documents @pxref{Multifile}, since it allows each file to
access the parsed information from all the other files in the document.
This is done by first reading the information from the master file, and
then recursively the information from each file stored in the master
file.@refill

The variables can also be done on a per file basis, by changing the file
local variables.

@example
% Local Variables: 
% TeX-parse-self: t
% TeX-auto-save: t
% End: 
@end example

Even when you have disabled the automatic parsing, you can force the
generation of style information by pressing @kbd{C-c C-n}.  This is
often the best choice, as you will be able to decide when it is
necessary to reparse the file.

@defopt TeX-parse-self
Parse file after loading it if no style hook is found for it.
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-auto-save
Automatically save style information when saving the buffer.
@end defopt

@deffn Command TeX-normal-mode @var{arg}
@kindex C-c C-n
(@kbd{C-c C-n}) Remove all information about this buffer, and apply the
style hooks again.  Save buffer first including style information.  With
optional argument, also reload the style hooks.
@end deffn

When AUC TeX saves your buffer, it will by default convert all tabs in
your buffer into spaces.  To disable this behaviour, insert the
following in your @file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
(setq TeX-auto-untabify nil)
@end lisp

@defopt TeX-auto-untabify
Automatically remove all tabs from a file before saving it.
@end defopt

Instead of disabling the parsing entirely, you can also speed it
significantly up by limiting the information it will search for (and
store) when parsing the buffer.  You can do this by setting the default
values for the buffer local variables @code{TeX-auto-regexp-list} and
@code{TeX-auto-parse-length} in your @file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
;; Only parse \documentstyle information.
(setq-default TeX-auto-regexp-list 'LaTeX-auto-minimal-regexp-list) 
;; The documentstyle command is usually near the beginning.
(setq-default TeX-auto-parse-length 2000)
@end lisp

This example will speed the parsing up significantly, but AUC @TeX{}
will no longer be able to provide completion for labels, macros,
environments, or bibitems specified in the document, nor will it know
what files belong to the document.

These variables can also be specified on a per file basis, by changing
the file local variables.

@example
% Local Variables: 
% TeX-auto-regexp-list: TeX-auto-full-regexp-list
% TeX-auto-parse-length: 999999
% End: 
@end example

@defopt TeX-auto-regexp-list
List of regular expressions used for parsing the current file.
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-auto-parse-length
Maximal length of TeX file that will be parsed.
@end defopt

The pre-specified lists of regexps are defined below.  You can use these
before loading AUC @TeX{} by quoting them, as in the example above.

@defvr Constant TeX-auto-empty-regexp-list
Parse nothing
@end defvr

@defvr Constant LaTeX-auto-minimal-regexp-list

There are several problems associated with editing non-English @TeX{}

First you will need a way to write non-ASCII characters.  You can either
use macros, or teach @TeX{} about the ISO character sets.  I prefer the
latter, it has the advantage that the usual standard emacs word
movement and case change commands will work.

With LaTeX2e, just add @samp{\usepackage[latin1]@{inputenc@}}.  Other
languages than Western European ones will probably have other encoding
needs.

To be able to display non-ASCII characters you will need an appropriate
font and a version of GNU Emacs capable of displaying 8-bit characters.
The manner in which this is supported differs between Emacsen, so you
need to take a look at your respective documentation.

A compromise is to use use an European character set when editing the
file, and convert to @TeX{} macros when reading and writing the files.

AUC @TeX{} supports style files for several languages.  Each style file
may modify some AUC @TeX{} to better support the language, and will run
a language specific hook that will allow you to for example change
ispell dictionary, or run code to change the keyboard remapping.  The
following will for example choose a Danish dictionary for documents
including the @file{dk.sty} file.  This requires parsing to be enabled,

To write Japanese text with AUC @TeX{} you need to have versions of
@TeX{} and Emacs that support Japanese.  There exist at least two
variants of @TeX{} for Japanese text (j@TeX{} and p@TeX{}), and AUC
@TeX{} can be used with MULE supported Emacsens.

To install Japanese support for AUC @TeX{}, copy @file{tex-jp.el} to
AUC @TeX{} installed directory.  Next two commands will automatically
install contributed files.

@example
make contrib
make install-contrib
@end example

See @file{INSTALLATION} and @file{Makefile} for more information.

To use the Japanese TeX variants, simply enter @code{japanese-tex-mode},
@code{japanese-latex-mode}, or @code{japanese-slitex-mode}, and
everything should work.  If not, send mail to Shinji Kobayashi
@samp{<koba@@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>}, who kindly donated the code for
supporting Japanese in AUC @TeX{}.  None of the primary AUC @TeX{}
maintainers understand Japanese, so they can not help you.

is useful.

@defopt TeX-default-mode

@cindex Parsing @TeX{}

Since AUC @TeX{} is so highly customizable, it makes sense that it is able
to customize itself.  The automatic customization consists of scanning
@TeX{} files and extracting symbols, environments, and things like that.

The automatic customization is done on three different levels.  The
global level is the level shared by all users at your site, and consists
of scanning the standard @TeX{} style files, and any extra styles added
locally for all users on the site.  The private level deals with those
style files you have written for your own use, and use in different
documents.  You may have a @file{~/lib/TeX/} directory where you store
useful style files for your own use.  The local level is for a specific
directory, and deals with writing customization for the files for your
normal @TeX{} documents.

If compared with the environment variable @code{TEXINPUTS}, the
global level corresponds to the directories built into @TeX{}.  The
private level corresponds to the directories you add yourself, except for
@file{.}, which is the local level.

@end menu

By default AUC @TeX{} will search for customization files in all the
global, private, and local style directories, but you can also set the
path directly.  This is useful if you for example want to add another
person's style hooks to your path.  Please note that all matching files
found in @code{TeX-style-path} are loaded, and all hooks defined in the
files will be executed.

@defopt TeX-style-path

recurse, a positive integer means go that far deep in the directory
hierarchy, t means recurse indefinitely.
@end defopt

By default, AUC @TeX{} will ignore files name @file{.}, @file{..},
@file{SCCS}, @file{RCS}, and @file{CVS}.

These files or directories will not be considered when searching for

Assuming that the automatic customization at the global level was done
when AUC @TeX{} was installed, your choice is now: will you use it?  If
you use it, you will benefit by having access to all the symbols and
environments available for completion purposes.  The drawback is slower

This file specifies that the largest kind of section in a LaTeX document
using the book document style is chapter.  The interesting thing to
notice is that the style file defines an (anonymous) function, and adds it
to the list of loaded style hooks by calling @code{TeX-add-style-hook}.

The first time the user indirectly tries to access some style specific
information, such as the largest sectioning command available, the style
hooks for all files directly or indirectly read by the current document
is executed.  The actual files will only be evaluated once, but the
hooks will be called for each buffer using the style file.

@cindex Defining macros in style hooks

The most common thing to define in a style hook is new symbols (@TeX{}
macros).  Most likely along with a description of the arguments to the
function, since the symbol itself can be defined automatically.

Here are a few examples from @file{latex.el}.

@lisp
(TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
 (function
  (lambda ()
     (TeX-add-symbols
     '("arabic" TeX-arg-counter)
     '("label" TeX-arg-define-label)
     '("ref" TeX-arg-label)
     '("newcommand" TeX-arg-define-macro [ "Number of arguments" ] t)
     '("newtheorem" TeX-arg-define-environment
       [ TeX-arg-environment "Numbered like" ]
       t [ TeX-arg-counter "Within counter" ])))))
@end lisp

@defun TeX-add-symbols @var{symbol} @dots{}
Add each @var{symbol} to the list of known symbols.
@end defun

Each argument to @code{TeX-add-symbols} is a list describing one symbol.
The head of the list is the name of the symbol, the remaining elements
describe each argument.

If there are no additional elements, the symbol will be inserted with
point inside braces.  Otherwise, each argument of this function should
match an argument of the @TeX{} macro.  What is done depends on the argument
type.

If a macro is defined multiple times, AUC @TeX{} will chose the one with
the longest definition (i.e. the one with the most arguments).

Thus, to overwrite
@example
        '("tref" 1) ; one argument
@end example
you can specify 
@example
        '("tref" TeX-arg-label ignore) ; two arguments
@end example

@code{ignore} is a function that does not do anything, so when you
insert a @samp{tref} you will be prompted for a label and no more.

@table @code
@item string
Use the string as a prompt to prompt for the argument.

@item number
Insert that many braces, leave point inside the first.

@item nil
Insert empty braces.

@item t
Insert empty braces, leave point between the braces.

@item other symbols
Call the symbol as a function.  You can define your
own hook, or use one of the predefined argument hooks.

@item list
If the car is a string, insert it as a prompt and the next
element as initial input.  Otherwise, call the car of the list with
the remaining elements as arguments. 

@item vector
Optional argument.  If it has more than one element, parse it
as a list, otherwise parse the only element as above.  Use square
brackets instead of curly braces, and is not inserted on empty user
input.
@end table

A lot of argument hooks have already been defined.  The first argument to
all hooks is a flag indicating if it is an optional argument.  It is up
to the hook to determine what to do with the remaining arguments, if
any.  Typically the next argument is used to overwrite the default
prompt. 

@ftable @code
@item TeX-arg-conditional
Implements if EXPR THEN ELSE.  If EXPR evaluates to true, parse THEN as an
argument list, else parse ELSE as an argument list.

@item TeX-arg-literal
Insert its arguments into the buffer.  Used for specifying extra syntax
for a macro.

@item TeX-arg-free
Parse its arguments but use no braces when they are inserted.

@item TeX-arg-eval
Evaluate arguments and insert the result in the buffer.

@item TeX-arg-file
Prompt for a tex or sty filename, and use it without the extension. Run
the file hooks defined for it.

@item TeX-arg-label

@item TeX-arg-macro

extension.  Run the style hooks for the file.

@item TeX-arg-define-label
Prompt for a label completing with known labels.  Add label to list of
defined labels.

@item TeX-arg-define-macro
Prompt for a @TeX{} macro with completion.  Add macro to list of defined
macros.

@item TeX-arg-define-environment

list of defined environments.

@item TeX-arg-define-cite

@item TeX-arg-define-counter
Prompt for a La@TeX{} counter.

@item TeX-arg-define-savebox
Prompt for a La@TeX{} savebox.

@item TeX-arg-corner

@item TeX-arg-tb
Prompt for a La@TeX{} side with completion.

@item TeX-arg-pagestyle
Prompt for a La@TeX{} pagestyle with completion.

@item TeX-arg-verb
Prompt for delimiter and text.

@item TeX-arg-pair
Insert a pair of numbers, use arguments for prompt. The numbers are
surrounded by parentheses and separated with a comma.

@item TeX-arg-size
Insert width and height as a pair.  No arguments.

@item TeX-arg-coordinate

@end ftable

If you add new hooks, you can assume that point is placed directly after
the previous argument, or after the macro name if this is the first
argument.  Please leave point located after the argument you are
inserting.  If you want point to be located somewhere else after all
hooks have been processed, set the value of @code{exit-mark}.  It will
point nowhere, until the argument hook sets it.@refill

@section Adding Support for Environments
@cindex Adding environments
@cindex Environments, adding
@cindex Defining environments in style hooks

Adding support for environments is very much like adding support for
@TeX{} macros, except that each environment normally only takes one
argument, an environment hook.  The example is again a short version of
@file{latex.el}.

@lisp
(TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
 (function
  (lambda ()
    (LaTeX-add-environments
     '("document" LaTeX-env-document)
     '("enumerate" LaTeX-env-item)
     '("itemize" LaTeX-env-item)
     '("list" LaTeX-env-list)))))
@end lisp 

@findex LaTeX-env-item
The only hook that is generally useful is @code{LaTeX-env-item}, which is
used for environments that contain items.  It is completely up to the
environment hook to insert the environment, but the function
@code{LaTeX-insert-environment} may be of some help.  The hook will be
called with the name of the environment as its first argument, and extra
arguments can be provided by adding them to a list after the hook.

For simple environments with arguments, for example defined with
@samp{\newenvironment}, you can make AUC @TeX{} prompt for the arguments
by giving the prompt strings in the call to
@code{LaTeX-add-environments}.  For example, if you have defined a
@code{loop} environment with the three arguments @var{from}, @var{to},
and @var{step}, you can add support for them in a style file.

@example
%% loop.sty

\newenvironment@{loop@}[3]@{...@}@{...@}
@end example

@lisp
;; loop.el

(TeX-add-style-hook "loop"
 (function
  (lambda ()
    (LaTeX-add-environments
     '("loop" "From" "To" "Step")))))
@end lisp

If an environment is defined multiple times, AUC @TeX{} will chose the
one with the longest definition.  Thus, if you have an enumerate style
file, and want it to replace the standard La@TeX{} enumerate hook above,
you could define an @file{enumerate.el} file as follows, and place it in
the appropriate style directory. 

@lisp
(TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
 (function
  (lambda ()
    (LaTeX-add-environments
     '("enumerate" LaTeX-env-enumerate foo)))))

(defun LaTeX-env-enumerate (environment &optional ignore) ...)
@end lisp

The symbol @code{foo} will be passed to @code{LaTeX-env-enumerate} as
the second argument, but since we only added it to overwrite the
definition in @file{latex.el} it is just ignored.

@defun LaTeX-add-environments @var{env} @dots{}
Add each @var{env} to list of loaded environments.
@end defun

@defun LaTeX-insert-environment @var{env} [ @var{extra} ]
Insert environment of type @var{env}, with optional argument @var{extra}.

@section Automatic Extraction of New Things
@cindex Parsing new macros
@cindex @file{macro.tex}

@cindex Changing the parser

The automatic @TeX{} information extractor works by searching for
regular expressions in the @TeX{} files, and storing the matched
information.  You can add support for new constructs to the parser,
something that is needed when you add new commands to define symbols.  

For example, in the file @file{macro.tex} I define the following macro.

@example
\newcommand@{\newmacro@}[5]@{%
\def#1@{#3\index@{#4@@#5~cite@{#4@}@}\nocite@{#4@}@}%
\def#2@{#5\index@{#4@@#5~cite@{#4@}@}\nocite@{#4@}@}%
@}
@end example

AUC @TeX{} will automatically figure out that @samp{newmacro} is a macro
that takes five arguments.  However, it is not smart enough to
automatically see that each time we use the macro, two new macros are
defined.  We can specify this information in a style hook file.

@lisp

@end lisp

When this file is first loaded, it adds a new entry to
@code{TeX-newmacro-regexp}, and defines a function to be called before
the parsing starts, and one to be called after the parsing is done.  It
also declares a variable to contain the data collected during parsing.
Finally, it adds a style hook which describes the @samp{newmacro} macro,
as we have seen it before.

So the general strategy is: Add a new entry to @code{TeX-newmacro-regexp}.
Declare a variable to contain intermediate data during parsing.  Add hook
to be called before and after parsing.  In this case, the hook before
parsing just initializes the variable, and the hook after parsing
collects the data from the variable, and adds them to the list of symbols
found.  

@defvar TeX-auto-regexp-list
List of regular expressions matching @TeX{} macro definitions.

The list has the following format ((REGEXP MATCH TABLE) @dots{}), that
is, each entry is a list with three elements.

REGEXP.  Regular expression matching the macro we want to parse.

MATCH.  A number or list of numbers, each representing one
parenthesized subexpression matched by REGEXP.

TABLE.  The symbol table to store the data.  This can be a function, in
which case the function is called with the argument MATCH.  Use
@code{TeX-match-buffer} to get match data.  If it is not a function, it
is presumed to be the name of a variable containing a list of match
data.  The matched data (a string if MATCH is a number, a list of
strings if MATCH is a list of numbers) is put in front of the table.
@end defvar

@defvar TeX-auto-prepare-hook nil
List of functions to be called before parsing a @TeX{} file.
@end defvar

@defvar TeX-auto-cleanup-hook nil
List of functions to be called after parsing a @TeX{} file.

This is a list of projects for AUC @TeX{}.  Bug reports and requests we
can not fix or honor right away will be added to this list.  If you have
some time for emacs lisp hacking, you are encouraged to try to provide a
solution to one of the following problems.  It might be a good idea to
mail me first, though.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Page count when compiling should (optionally) go to modeline of the
window where the compilation command was invoked, instead of the output
window.  Suggested by Karsten Tinnefeld
<tinnefeld@@irb.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.

@item
Command to insert a macrodefinition in the preamble, without moving
point from the current location.  Suggested by 
"Jeffrey C. Ely" <ely@@nwu.edu>.

@item
Filling messes up comments, but only at the end of the file.  Reported
by Juergen Reiss <psy3022@@rzbox.uni-wuerzburg.de>.

@item
@kbd{C-c C-q C-e} doesn't work properly on nested itemize environments.
Reported by  "Robert B. Love"  <rlove@@raptor.rmNUG.ORG>.

@item 
One suggestion for AUC-TeX: I think that the font command C-c C-f C-r,
which produces \textrm@{@} in a LaTeX file, should instead produce
either \textrm@{@} or \mathrm@{@}, depending on whether one is in math
mode or not. --- John Palmieri <palmieri@@math.mit.edu>

@item
A way to add and overwrite math mode entries in style files, and to
decide where they should be.  Suggested by Remo Badii <Remo.Badii@@psi.ch>.

@item
Create template for (first) line of tabular environment.

@item
I think prompting for the master is the intended behaviour.  It
corresponds to a `shared' value for TeX-master.

There should probably be a `none' value which wouldn't query for the
master, but instead disable all features that relies on TeX-master.

This default value for TeX-master could then be controled with mapping
based on the extension.

@item
@kbd{C-c '} should alway stay in the current window, also when it find a
new file.

@item
@code{LaTeX-fill-environment} does not indent the closing @samp{\end}.

@item
Rewrite @file{ltx-help.el} and put it in @file{latex.el}.  Fix also:
@example
From: Denby Wong <DnB@@slip224.qlink.QueensU.CA>

 1) change documentation regarding where to get the 
    latest version (at CTAN at pip.shsu.edu for me)
    under info/latex2e-help-texinfo/

 2) change or provide choice over which version to
    use.  There are three references to the info
    node "(latex)" in the file which should be 
    "(latex2e)"  for the new file.  

From: Piet van Oostrum <piet@@cs.ruu.nl>

One of the annoying things of latex-help is that if you ask for \LARGE, you
get \large if you have case-fold-search=t. This is really info's problem as
it doesn't reset it for a search of the node, but it would be easy to stick
a (let (case-fold-search) in latex-help.
@end example

@item
It should be possible to insert a default preamble containing
e.g. @code{usepackage} declarations, perhaps depending on the document
class. 

@item
Multiple argument completion for @samp{\bibliography}.  In general, I
ought to make @kbd{,} special for these kind of completions. 

@item
Do not overwrite emacs warnings about existing auto-save files when
loading a new file.

@item
Suggest @samp{makindex} when appropriate.

@item
Maybe the regexp for matching a TeX symbol during parsing should be
@samp{"\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\|.\\)"} ---
@samp{<thiemann@@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>} Peter Thiemann.

@item
AUC TeX should be able to parse La@TeX{}2e @file{.cls} files.  Here are
the regexps by @samp{<thiemann@@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>} Peter
Thiemann. 

@example
     ("\\\\DeclareRobustCommand@{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)@}?\\[\\([0-9]+\\)\\]\
\\[\\([^\]\\\\\n\r]+\\)\\]"
      (1 2 3) LaTeX-auto-optional)
     ("\\\\DeclareRobustCommand@{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)@}?\\[\\([0-9]+\\)\\]"
      (1 2) LaTeX-auto-arguments)
     ("\\\\DeclareRobustCommand@{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)@}?" 1 TeX-auto-symbol)
     ("\\\\DeclareFixedFont@{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)@}?"
      1 TeX-auto-symbol)
     ("\\\\Declare\\(Text\\|Old\\)FontCommand@{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)@}?"
      2 TeX-auto-symbol)
     ("\\\\DeclareMath\\(Symbol\\|Delimiter\\|Accent\\|Radical\\)@{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)@}?"
      2 TeX-auto-symbol)
     ;;; it is also valid to declare just a single symbol, e.g. <,
     ;;; with \DeclareMathSymbol but it is not necessary to register that here
     ("\\\\DeclareText\\(Command\\|Symbol\\|Accent\\|Composite\\)@{?\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)@}?"
      2 TeX-auto-symbol)
@end example

@item
Use index files (when available) to speed up @kbd{C-c C-m include
@key{RET}}. 

@item
Option not to calculate very slow completions like for 
@kbd{C-c C-m include @key{RET}}.@refill

@item
AUC @TeX{} should not parse verbatim environments.

@item
Font menu should be created from @code{TeX-font-list}.

@item
Installation procedure written purely in emacs lisp.

@item
Format La@TeX{} comment blocks.

@item
Included PostScript files should also be counted as part of the
document. 

@item
The argument to @samp{\verb} may be broken when filling if it contains a
space.  This should be fixed or documented.  Suggested by several
people.

@item
The parser should catch warnings about undefined crossreferences.
Suggested by Richard Hirsch @samp{i3080501@@ws.rz.tu-bs.de}.

@item
A nice hierarchical by-topic organization of all officially documented
LaTeX macros, available from the menu bar.

@item
Make @samp{`} check for math context in @code{LaTeX-math-mode}. and
simply self insert if not in a math context.

@item
Make @code{TeX-insert-dollar} more robust.  Currently it can be fooled
by @samp{\mbox}'es and escaped double dollar for example.

@item
La@TeX{} formatting should skip @code{verbatim} environments.

@item
@code{TeX-command-default} should be set from the master file, if not
set locally.  Suggested by Peter Whaite @samp{<peta@@cim.mcgill.ca>}.

@item
Make AUC @TeX{} work with @samp{crypt++}.  Suggested by Chris Moore
@samp{<Chris.Moore@@src.bae.co.uk>}.

@item
Fix bug with @code{TeX-show-environment} from hidden document
environment.

@item
Function to check if you are in math mode (between two dollar signs).
Suggested by Jan Erik Odegard @samp{<odegard@@dsp.rice.edu>}

@item
The @samp{Spell} command should apply to all files in a document.  Maybe
it could try to restrict to files that have been modified since last
spell check?  Suggested by Ravinder Bhumbla @samp{<rbhumbla@@ucsd.edu>}. 

@item
Make @key{.} check for abbreviations and sentences ending with capital
letters.

@item
Use Emacs 19 minibuffer history to choose between previewers, and other
stuff.  Suggested by John Interrante
@samp{<interran@@uluru.Stanford.EDU>}. 

@item 
Make features.

A new command @code{TeX-update} (@kbd{C-c C-u}) could be used to create
an up-to-date dvi file by repeatedly running Bib@TeX{}, MakeIndex and
(La)@TeX{}, until an error occurs or we are done.

An alternative is to have an @samp{Update} command that ensures the
@samp{dvi} file is up to date.  This could be called before printing and
previewing.

@item
Documentation of variables that can be set in a style hook.

We need a list of what can safely be done in an ordinary style hook.
You can not set a variable that AUC TeX depends on, unless AUC TeX knows
that it has to run the style hooks first.

Here is the start of such a list.
@table @code

@item LaTeX-add-environments

@item TeX-add-symbols

@item LaTeX-add-labels

@item LaTeX-add-bibliographies

@item LaTeX-largest-level

@end table

@item 
Correct indentation for tabular, tabbing, table, math, and array
environments.

@item 
Optional special indentation after an @samp{\item}.

@example
\begin@{itemize@}
\item blabalaskdfjlas lajf adf
      lkfjl  af jasl lkf jlsdf jlf 
\item f lk jldjf lajflkas flf af
\end@{itemize@}
@end example 

@item
Completion for counters and sboxes.

@item
Outline should be (better) supported in @TeX{} mode.

At least, support headers, trailers, as well as TeX-outline-extra. 

@item
@code{TeX-header-start} and @code{TeX-trailer-end}.

We might want these, just for fun (and outlines)

@item
Plain @TeX{} and La@TeX{} specific header and trailer expressions.

We should have a way to globally specify the default value of the header
and trailer regexps. 

@item
Add support for original @code{TeX-mode} keybindings.

A third initialization file (@file{tex-mode.el}) containing an emulator
of the standard @code{TeX-mode} would help convince some people to
change to AUC @TeX{}.@refill

@item
Make @code{TeX-next-error} parse ahead and store the results in a list,
using markers to remember buffer positions in order to be more robust
with regard to line numbers and changed files.  This is what
@code{next-error} does. (Or did, until Emacs 19).

@item
When @code{LaTeX-environment} is given an argument, change the current
environment.  Be smart about @samp{\item[]} versus @samp{\item } and
labels like @samp{fig:} versus @samp{tab:}.

@item
Check out if lightning completion from Ultra @TeX{} is anything for us.

@item
Finish the @TeX{}info mode.  For one thing, many @TeX{}info mode
commands do not accept braces around their arguments.

@item
BibTeX mode.

@item
Support for AMSLaTeX style files.

@item
Hook up the letter environment with `bbdb.el'.

@item
Make the letter environment hook produce `documentstyle' too.
