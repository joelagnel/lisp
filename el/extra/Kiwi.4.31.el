;;	- If user connects to server at host foo.bar.se and foo.se is an

;;	  of what nick we have.
;;	- Renamed irc-linkstree into irc-linksinfo.
;;	- Kludged the mess with 2.6 servers first being names 2.6pre19,
;;	  later 2.6.1a so the latter gets a HIGHER irc-edit-version number.
;;	- Parse RPL 364 messages, ie answers to /LINKS in 2.6.1 servers.
;;	- For now, ignore message 318.
;; v4.13 Thu Jun 13 10:28:31 1991	sojge@mizar.docs.uu.se
;;	- Handle ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE (433) at "login" time.

;;	- Clean up channel names as they can contain cntrl-chars too.
;;	- Fixed display of time to be nicer.
;;	- Make the (interactive)-part of the irc-execute-* commands more alike
;;	  each other.
;;	- Bugfix: understand ESC in channel names in a few more places.
;;	- Bugfix: understand "i" etc, not only "+i" when parsing MODE.
;;	- Made /COMMAND be shown in buffer when doing command by keys.
;;	- Amazingly how yours truly can mess up code! Fixed /LEAVE again :-)
;; v4.12 Sun Mar  3 02:45:21 1991	sojge@mizar.docs.uu.se
;;	- Changed wording on ctcp (client-to-client protocol) answer for
;;	  a VERSION query.

;;	  remembered in irc-nicknames as being present.
;;	- Made /WHO USER do a WHOIS USER, while /WHO CHANNEL does a
;;	  WHO CHANNEL.

;; v3.11 Thu Aug 30 17:41:18 1990	sojge@mizar.docs.uu.se
;;	- Sigh, fixed bug in irc-execute-whowas. I'd better do a RPLACA...
;; v3.10 Thu Aug 30 15:47:36 1990	sojge@mizar.docs.uu.se
;;	- Added irc-execute-whowas (long due).
;;	- Fixed som other minor bugs. I hope.
;;	- BUGFIX in irc-remove-from-tree, do comparsion in upcase.
;;	- Made irc-execute-msg tell if receivers are users or channels.
;;	- Fixed bug in irc-is-channel. ("-77?" is NOT a channel ID).
;;	- Recognize Kanji message and replace with generic string.
;; v3.9 Wed Aug 22 08:07:21 1990	sojge@mizar.docs.uu.se
;;	- Added a rudimentary function irc-execute-kick.
;;	- Wrote predicate irc-is-channelname.

;;	- Added some more (let ((irc-msg-cont-used ...) around irc-insert's.
;;	- Made irc-explain-mode work.
;;	- Changed count in irc-execute-send so irc-msg-sent is right justified.
;; v3.8 Sun Aug 19 04:55:31 1990	sojge@mizar.docs.uu.se
;;	- BUGFIX: v3.6 introduced bug making it hard to join negative channels,
;;	  now it's easy again.
;; v3.7 Sat Aug 18 23:48:56 1990	sojge@mizar.docs.uu.se
;;	- Set irc-msg-cont-used before calling irc-insert for some lists.
;;	- Understand ERR_NOTONCHANNEL message.
;;	- Don't explecitly request MOTD (message of the day) when connected

;;	- Changed format of how the status in a WHO listing appears.
;;	- Ignore error messages from other old server complaining MODE being
;;	  an unknown command.

;;	  first letter in channelname is a digit).
;;	- Understand reply message 324.
;;	- Say "using default" after a "/query *".
;; v3.5 Thu Jun 14 07:23:51 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Teached /KILL to understand comments.
;;	- Added a simplistic header to linreply display.
;;	- Make it possible for away messages to start with :.
;;	- Save nickname in irc-parse-wallops.
;; v3.4 Mon Jun 11 03:55:08 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Added operator level command /CONNECT.
;;	- Remapped C-C C-S to be irc-execute-squit.
;;	- Added operator level command /SQUIT.
;;	- Added operator level command /WALLOPS.
;;	- Added some support for mnemonic channel ID's, ie not only numbers
;;	  but also strings can identify a channel. Probaly a bit buggy.
;;	  Problem: How long can an ID be?
;;	- Made irc-channel into a string, from being a number.
;;	- Made /WHO SOJGE show a one line WHO reply (plus header) about SOJGE,
;;	  ie not doing a WHOIS for SOJGE. Will probaly change.
;; v3.3 Wed Jun  6 07:26:57 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Keep statistics on LIST replies in a new way.
;;	- Made irc-add-to-tree do it's string comparsions in upper case, this
;;	  prevents the same name in two different cases to be stored.
;;	- Corrected minor bug in irc-parse-notice about reconizing USERS
;;	  replies.
;;	- Changed (irc-insert "foo\nbar") into 
;;	  (irc-insert "foo") (irc-insert "bar")
;;	- Made the "IRC halted" message a bit more flashy.
;; v3.2 Mon Jun  4 19:59:00 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- When on a fast terminal (see irc-terminal-is-slow), don't bother
;;	  to collect various replies in temporary storage lists. Display the
;;	  unsorted entrys as fast as they come in.
;;	- Improved handling of /USERS replies.
;; v3.1 Sat May 26 03:05:46 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Corrected bug which prevented LINK to actually display any data...
;; v3.0 Sat May 26 02:21:52 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Changed version from 1.9 to 3.0 in one step.

;; v1.9 Sat May 19 14:44:58 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Wrote irc-parse-pong to collect host name from ping messages.
;;	- Made irc-extract-hosts skip parts between between nodename and "!".
;;	- Made WHO lists more mnemonic.
;;	- Made LINREPLYs be gathered in a variable before sorting and
;;	  displaying it even for 2.2 type servers.
;;	- Make client ask for the message of the day (MOTD) when seeing
;;	  the (final line of the) servers welcome message, not at "start up".
;;	- Look as far as 1/3 of the line from the right when choosing a
;;	  break point in irc-insert. Makes a few listing look better on
;;	  a 80 column screen.
;;	- Take care of "unknown connection" message in irc-parse-notice.
;; v1.8 Thu May 17 00:53:20 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Say "use /HELP" if user seems totaly confused on channel 0.
;;	- Fixed bug in irc-parse-whoreply, don't add header to irc-whotree.
;;	- Say "no users" on a 2.4 (or later) server if user issued /who 
;;	  for an empty channel.
;; v1.7 Wed May 16 23:34:01 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Show time when being pinged, not every x minutes.
;;	- Don't crash if server closed connection, reopen it,
;;	- Skip some messages like START OF MOTD ...

;;	  into irc-maintain-tree.
;;	- Made (most) error messages start with a % sign.
;;	- Renamed IRC-WHOTREE into IRC-NAMESTREE.
;;	- Keeps track of what version the used server is, and depending on it
;;	  uses (or not) the fact that it's possible to gather WHOREPLYs and
;;	  LINREPLYs before displaying it. Exploits the "end of who/links"
;;	  message from the server.
;;	- Understands new MOTD notices, collects data until end-of-motd-list.
;;	- Better handling of extracting hostnames from different places.
;;	  Uses irc-extract-hostname.
;;	- Made irc-maintain-tree use upcase and irc-extract-hostname on items
;;	  for irc-hosttree.
;;	- Now extracts info from MOTD replies.
;; v1.6 Mon Apr  9 22:25:22 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Improved handling of %-signs in messages (data part so to say) by
;;	  doing a s/%/%%/ in functions irc-parse-public and irc-parse-privmsg.
;; v1.5 Mon Apr  9 17:32:51 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Extract server names from KILL messages paths.
;; v1.4 Fri Apr  6 01:30:46 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Removed s/%/%%/ from irc-parse-server-msg.
;;	- Let function irc check that the *IRC* buffer has an open stream
;;	  "process" associated with it before trying to switch to the buffer.
;;	  This is handy when the stream has been closed.
;; v1.3 Tue Apr  3 23:51:38 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Made irc.el cope with new format on some NOTICE messages.
;;	  (:server NOTICE ...)
;; v1.2 Fri Mar 30 03:42:31 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Changed protocol, initiate with USER <username> * * <realname> now.
;;	- Changed misc. error messages to start with %.
;;	- Made a few "server message unkown" messages tell where they are
;;	  in the code.
;;	- Added code to make WHOIS * invokde WHOIS for all users.
;;	- Made irc-parse-channel set irc-msg-cont-used.
;;	- Added and removed code for automatic greeting of new joiners to
;;	  channels, in irc-parse-channel. But this doesn't seem to be enough.
;;	  More debugging needed ...
;;	- Made irc.el understand MOTD messages from server, not reliying on
;;	  all lines in MOTD file starting with a blank.
;; v1.1 Mon Mar 26 03:37:03 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Cleaned up some more, in how things are displayed. Servers
;;	  domain names are displayed in upper case, in
;;	  irc-parse-linrpl and their information text "as is". Some
;;	  headers  are underlined.
;;	- Corrected (?) bug in irc-parse-RPL which handled RPL_MOTD
;;	  messages incorrectly.
;; v1.0 Wed Feb 28 21:53:49 1990	sojge@emil.csd.uu.se
;;	- Changed look and feel by introducing a couple of variables
;;	  and removing the conserve-space kludge. Apperence is now user
;;	  settable.
;;	- Rewritten buggy irc-insert so it works. No more infinite looping.
;;	- Added a few key bindings.
;;	- Made irc-parse-RPL (at RPL_WHOISSERVER) and irc-parse-notice add
;;	  information to the irc-hostlist, just like irc-parse-linreply does.
;; v0.9 Sometime 1989	flax@mizar.docs.uu.se
;;	- Made irc-linreply add to a list of known hosts so completion of
;;	  host names in irc-execute-admin and others will work. Neat.

;; 27-Sep-1989		Gnu Maint Acct	(gnu at life.pawl.rpi.edu)
;;    Last Modified: Wed Sep 27 18:56:19 1989 #6
;;    * Fixed a misrefenced variable in irc-parse-server-msg so that lines
;;      which can't be parsed insert only that unparsable line.
;;    * Added irc-parse-topic and changed irc-signals and irc-notifies
;;      appropriately.
;;    * Moved setting of irc-channel to irc-parse-channel from irc-execute-join
;;      because a channel change isn't guaranteed (ie, trying to change to
;;      a channel not in 0-10 which has ten users on it).
;;    * Made irc-message-stamp 'private by default. (Geoff)
;;    * Made irc-time-stamp 0 by default.      (Also Geoff)
;;      This tickled an unseen bug in the start-up function which incremented
;;      irc-last-stamp.  It's fixed now.
;;    * Fixed a bug with interactive irc-execute-names -- prefix arg was being
;;      (list ...)ed.
;;    * Fixed a bug in irc-parse-namreply that dropped a name in the output
;;      when a line got wrapped.
;;    * Added /lusers.  I really dislike the name.
;;    * Added irc-parse-kill.
;;    * Made irc-execute-msg strip one space after the colon in messages;
;;      ie, "tale: hi" will send "hi" as a message not " hi".
;;    * Took out hardcoded width numbers for word-wrapping.  Uses
;;      (window-width) instead.
;;    * Added to the regexp for failed nickname changes in irc-parse-error;
;;      the sentences got changed in the newer servers.
;;    * Wrapped irc-check-time around display-time-filter for better accuracy
;;      if a display-time process is running.
;;    * Made the "IRC Session finished" message include the time.
;;    * Added irc-conserve-space to imitate the C client message style.  I
;;      really dislike it aesthetically, but it is handy for people running
;;      on 24 line screens and at slow baud rates. (Kimmel & others)
;;    * Support IRCNICK and IRCSERVER environment variables at load time. (Kim)
;;    * Made /WHO call /WHOIS if given a non-numeric argument.  (Nate)
;;    * Fixed a bug where an alias would be executed before an exactly matching
;;      command; ie, alias /WHOALIAS whould execute when /WHO was entered.
;;    * Runs things in auto-fill-mode with a fill-column of 75 by default.
;;    * Processes the whole input region as one line instead of line-at-a-time.
;;    * Made irc-change-alias for non-interactive setting/removing of aliases;
;;      ie, via irc-mode-hook.  No frills.  (Chris & Nate)
;;    * _Finally_ got around to adding parsing of numeric notices for new
;;      servers.

To make your GNU Emacs know of this IRC user interface, you can add
the following command to your GNU Emacs initialisation file (normaly
.emacs) in your home directory:
        (autoload 'irc \"Kiwi\"
            \"Internet Relay Chat user interface.\" t nil)

This will make your Emacs to load the library file Kiwi.elc or Kiwi.el
when you typing M-x irc RET. The file must be in one of the
directories mentioned in the variable load-path. (You can check this
variables value by typing C-h v load-path RET). You can compile the
file Kiwi.el by typing M-x byte-compile-file RET Kiwi.el RET to get
Kiwi.elc.

At startup time of IRC, you may want to initiate some settings and
give some commands. This can be done by setting some variables in your
GNU Emacs initialisation file (normaly called .emacs). Some typical
initialisations may be

             irc-startup-hook '(lambda ()
                                (irc-execute-command \"links *.se\")
                                (irc-execute-command \"who *.se\")))

This will make IRC use about 1/3 of the screen when popping up a
window (this happens for instance when you have deselcted all IRC
windows and someone sends you a message). Also, the information string
for you (which can contain any information you choose) is initiated.
When a server says \"welcome\", you will be shown all active servers
in Sweden (SE) and all active users using IRC in Sweden.

Don't give the leading / in the arguments to irc-execute-command.

If you want more control over how to display public and/or private messages
(at the time exluding WALLs and WALLOPSs) you can use this clumsy way (be
patient, a more user friendly method is on it's way) of setting the variables
irc-public-insert and irc-private-insert to functions taking 3 strings as
arguments, namely the name of the sender, name of the receiver (user or channel
name normaly) and the message itself (in raw format, after extracting the
client-to-client protocol stuff). All this sums up to, that if you don't know
elisp, you probaly don't want to use this method, or else just change the
control string constants in the examples below.
Examples:
  (setq
   irc-public-insert '(lambda (from to msg)
		       (let* ((same-chan (string= (upcase irc-channel)
						  (upcase to)))
			      (hdr
			       (format (if same-chan
					   \"%s %9s:  \"
					   \"%s %9s/%s:  \")
				       (if (and irc-message-stamp
						(not (eq irc-message-stamp
							 'private)))
					   (irc-get-time)
					   \"\")
				       from
				       to))
			      (irc-msg-cont-used
			       (make-string 
				(min (length hdr)
				     (/ (window-width (get-buffer-window
						       (current-buffer)))
					2))
				? )))
			 (irc-insert
			  (concat hdr (irc-clean-up-message msg)))))
   irc-private-insert '(lambda (from to msg)
			(let* ((to-whom
				(cond ((string= (upcase irc-nick-used)
						(upcase to))
				       \"*%s %s*  \")
				      ((irc-is-broadcastname to)
				       (concat \"=%s %s BROADCAST to all\"
					       \"users on IRC server(s)\"
					       \" \\\"%s\\\"=  \"))
				      (t \"*%s %s/%s*  \")))
			       (hdr
				(format to-whom
					(if (and
					     irc-message-stamp
					     (eq irc-message-stamp
						 'private))
					    (irc-get-time)
					    \"\")
					from
					to))
			       (irc-msg-cont-used (make-string 
						   (min (length hdr)
							(/ (window-width (get-buffer-window (current-buffer)))
							   2))
						   ? )))
			  (irc-insert
			   (concat hdr (irc-clean-up-message msg))))))

Hint: the internal control strings uses 2 or 3 of the %s to write the time,
the senders name and the receivers name. If only 2 %s are given, the receivers
name won't be written.

(defun irc-execute-privmsg (str)
  "Usage: /MSG recipient(s) message

This command is provided simply for compatability with the C client.
It is preferable instead to just type the name of the user followed by
a semi-colon and then the message. That is, \"tale;hi!\" will send the
message \"hi!\" to the user with the nickname which starts with
\"tale\".  A semi-colon at the beginning of the line means to send to
the last recipient explicity specified; typing a semi-colon at the
beginning of a line expands it to the last recipient(s) specified. The
recipients for a message can be a comma separated list of users and/or
channels. Don't use any spaces left of the semi-colon.

You can send messages to users and channels, and if you are an enabled
IRC operator, you can also send broadcasts to server machines and
client machines.

Examples:
/msg wiz hi there           send \"hi there\" to user with nickname wiz
wiz;hi there                send to user wiz
msa,wiz;hi there            send to the users wiz and msa
42;hi there                 send into channel 42
42,wiz;hi there             channel 42 and user wiz

If you are an enabled IRC operator:
$minsk.docs.uu.se;...       send a message to all users using server minsk
$*.se;...                   send to all users using swedish servers
#cia.docs.uu.se;...         send to all users running their clients on cia

Get a list of the users on IRC.  Optional argument \"channel\" means to show

User can be any mask, ie *.se for current swedish IRCjunkies.

Each user is indicated on a separate line with their nickname, status,
channel, login name, host and real name. The second column, \"Stat\"
gives the status for the user, and is shown as a four letter word (:-)
according to the combination of their attributes. The possible
attributes are being an IRC operator, being a channel operator and
being marked as being away.

                                          Status field
A normal user having no attributes set:     (blank)
A normal user marked as being away:          Away
An IRC operator with no other attribues:     Iopr
An IRC operator marked as being away:        IoAw
A channel operator with no other attributes: Copr
A channel operator marked as being away:     CoAw
User being both IRC- and channel operator:   ICop
As above but also marked as being away:      ICAw

Being ignored takes precedence over all
other attributes, always shown as:           IGNR     (cf \"/HELP IGNORE\"). 

Users being on either no channel at all, or on channels with the mode
PRIVATE are appear with a blank \"Channel\" field. If you are
connected to a server of version 2.6, and are requesting a \"general\"
who listing (ie for users potentially on different channels), all
users \"Channel\" field will be blank.

An %-sign is appended to the name or number of your current
channel.

BE WARNED: on some servers, the operators CAN see who's on a negative channel.
On some of these servers, the channel number is disclosed, on others only
the fact that a user is on a negative channel, but not which one.
The same goes for \"private\" and \"secret\" channels.

If a single \"user\" is given as the argument, (ie a word starting with neither
a + nor a digit) it is taken to be the nickname of a user on IRC and more
information, if available, is given about the person.

If this function is called interactively then the prefix argument is used

of \"-\" or \"*\" means the current channel."

Events are added with +event or simply event; they are removed with -event.
+ adds all supported events and - removes all supported events.  More than
one event can be specified in the arguments.  In case of conflict, the argument
which appears later overrides the argument with which it conflicts.

Currently supported by /EVENT are the \"ctcp\", \"join\", \"nick\", \"quit\"

CTCP happens whenever someone send you a CTCP query.
Join happens whenever someone enters or leaves a channel which you are on.
Nick occurs when someone changes nicknames; recognition of this event is
currently limited to when the person making the change is on the same channel
as you.
Quit happens when someone quits from IRC and you see it.
Topic happens when the topic of a channel you listen to is changed.

The following modes exist for channels:
   a      Make channel anonymous (not supported by any servers yet)
   b      Manipulate a channels list of banned people
   i      Make channel joinable only with an invitation
   k      Add or remove channel key (password)
   l      Limit the number of users on the channel (argument: count)
   m      Make channel moderated
   n      Forbid /MSG's into channel
   o      Make someone a channel operator of this channel (argument: user)
   p      Make the channel private (ie channel invisible, users shown as being
          on some private channel)
   s      Make the channel secret (ie both channel and users invisible)
   t      Lock the topic of the channel (only settable by channel operators)
   v      Gives a user a voice on a moderated channel

The following modes exist for a user:
   i      Invisible
   o      Operator on IRC - can only be set with /OPER command
   s      Statusmessages, receive from server
   w      WALLOPS, receive from server
At the moment, only one self can be manipulated, and only i, s and w
can be set.

Prepend the mode command character with a + to turn the correspending
mode on, or with a - to turn it off.

Examples:
    /mode                    Show the mode of the current channel.
    /mode #foo               Show the mode of the channel named \"#foo\".
    /mode #foo +t            Locks the topic of channel \"#foo\".
    /mode * +i+o WiZ         Makes the current channel invite only and
                             gives user WiZ channel operator status.

event.  Remove all signals for an event with -event.  /SIGNAL + or /SIGNAL -
adds or removes all signals respectively.  Multiple arguments are accepted;
later ones take precedence over the ones which came before them.  For example,

Set time-stamping for IRC.  + means to turn it on for all messages from users

that class of message and -event means to disable it for those messages.  An
integer interval means to insert a message indicating the time every N minutes,
where N is the interval.  With no arguments simply insert a message indicating
the current time-stamps.

The current time in HH:MM format can appear two different ways in IRC.  One is
to have it associate with 'event'; two events, 'private' and 'public' messages,
are supported this way.  The other is to have it as a stand-alone message
indicating the current time.  Both can be very useful in noting when someone
actually sent you a message or when another event happened if you happen to be
away for a while.  The accuracy of the interval timer is currently limited to
0-2 minutes beyond the interval if display-time is not running; accuracy is
greatly improved if it is.  It can be turned off by setting the interval
to 0."
