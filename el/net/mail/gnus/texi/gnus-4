10.7.2.1 Required Back End Functions
....................................

`(nnchoke-retrieve-headers ARTICLES &optional GROUP SERVER FETCH-OLD)'
     ARTICLES is either a range of article numbers or a list of
     `Message-ID's.  Current back ends do not fully support either--only
     sequences (lists) of article numbers, and most back ends do not
     support retrieval of `Message-ID's.  But they should try for both.

     The result data should either be HEADs or NOV lines, and the result
     value should either be `headers' or `nov' to reflect this.  This
     might later be expanded to `various', which will be a mixture of
     HEADs and NOV lines, but this is currently not supported by Gnus.

     If FETCH-OLD is non-`nil' it says to try fetching "extra headers",
     in some meaning of the word.  This is generally done by fetching
     (at most) FETCH-OLD extra headers less than the smallest article
     number in `articles', and filling the gaps as well.  The presence
     of this parameter can be ignored if the back end finds it
     cumbersome to follow the request.  If this is non-`nil' and not a
     number, do maximum fetches.

     Here's an example HEAD:

          221 1056 Article retrieved.
          Path: ifi.uio.no!sturles
          From: sturles@ifi.uio.no (Sturle Sunde)
          Newsgroups: ifi.discussion
          Subject: Re: Something very droll
          Date: 27 Oct 1994 14:02:57 +0100
          Organization: Dept. of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway
          Lines: 26
          Message-ID: <38o8e1$a0o@holmenkollen.ifi.uio.no>
          References: <38jdmq$4qu@visbur.ifi.uio.no>
          NNTP-Posting-Host: holmenkollen.ifi.uio.no
          .

     So a `headers' return value would imply that there's a number of
     these in the data buffer.

     Here's a BNF definition of such a buffer:

          headers        = *head
          head           = error / valid-head
          error-message  = [ "4" / "5" ] 2number " " <error message> eol
          valid-head     = valid-message *header "." eol
          valid-message  = "221 " <number> " Article retrieved." eol
          header         = <text> eol

     (The version of BNF used here is the one used in RFC822.)

     If the return value is `nov', the data buffer should contain
     "network overview database" lines.  These are basically fields
     separated by tabs.

          nov-buffer = *nov-line
          nov-line   = field 7*8[ <TAB> field ] eol
          field      = <text except TAB>

     For a closer look at what should be in those fields, *note
     Headers::.

`(nnchoke-open-server SERVER &optional DEFINITIONS)'
     SERVER is here the virtual server name.  DEFINITIONS is a list of
     `(VARIABLE VALUE)' pairs that define this virtual server.

     If the server can't be opened, no error should be signaled.  The
     back end may then choose to refuse further attempts at connecting
     to this server.  In fact, it should do so.

     If the server is opened already, this function should return a
     non-`nil' value.  There should be no data returned.

`(nnchoke-close-server &optional SERVER)'
     Close connection to SERVER and free all resources connected to it.
     Return `nil' if the server couldn't be closed for some reason.

     There should be no data returned.

`(nnchoke-request-close)'
     Close connection to all servers and free all resources that the
     back end have reserved.  All buffers that have been created by
     that back end should be killed.  (Not the `nntp-server-buffer',
     though.)  This function is generally only called when Gnus is
     shutting down.

     There should be no data returned.

`(nnchoke-server-opened &optional SERVER)'
     If SERVER is the current virtual server, and the connection to the
     physical server is alive, then this function should return a
     non-`nil' value.  This function should under no circumstances
     attempt to reconnect to a server we have lost connection to.

     There should be no data returned.

`(nnchoke-status-message &optional SERVER)'
     This function should return the last error message from SERVER.

     There should be no data returned.

`(nnchoke-request-article ARTICLE &optional GROUP SERVER TO-BUFFER)'
     The result data from this function should be the article specified
     by ARTICLE.  This might either be a `Message-ID' or a number.  It
     is optional whether to implement retrieval by `Message-ID', but it
     would be nice if that were possible.

     If TO-BUFFER is non-`nil', the result data should be returned in
     this buffer instead of the normal data buffer.  This is to make it
     possible to avoid copying large amounts of data from one buffer to
     another, while Gnus mainly requests articles to be inserted
     directly into its article buffer.

     If it is at all possible, this function should return a cons cell
     where the `car' is the group name the article was fetched from,
     and the `cdr' is the article number.  This will enable Gnus to
     find out what the real group and article numbers are when fetching
     articles by `Message-ID'.  If this isn't possible, `t' should be
     returned on successful article retrieval.

`(nnchoke-request-group GROUP &optional SERVER FAST)'
     Get data on GROUP.  This function also has the side effect of
     making GROUP the current group.

     If FAST, don't bother to return useful data, just make GROUP the
     current group.

     Here's an example of some result data and a definition of the same:

          211 56 1000 1059 ifi.discussion

     The first number is the status, which should be 211.  Next is the
     total number of articles in the group, the lowest article number,
     the highest article number, and finally the group name.  Note that
     the total number of articles may be less than one might think
     while just considering the highest and lowest article numbers, but
     some articles may have been canceled.  Gnus just discards the
     total-number, so whether one should take the bother to generate it
     properly (if that is a problem) is left as an exercise to the
     reader.  If the group contains no articles, the lowest article
     number should be reported as 1 and the highest as 0.

          group-status = [ error / info ] eol
          error        = [ "4" / "5" ] 2<number> " " <Error message>
          info         = "211 " 3* [ <number> " " ] <string>

`(nnchoke-close-group GROUP &optional SERVER)'
     Close GROUP and free any resources connected to it.  This will be
     a no-op on most back ends.

     There should be no data returned.

`(nnchoke-request-list &optional SERVER)'
     Return a list of all groups available on SERVER.  And that means
     _all_.

     Here's an example from a server that only carries two groups:

          ifi.test 0000002200 0000002000 y
          ifi.discussion 3324 3300 n

     On each line we have a group name, then the highest article number
     in that group, the lowest article number, and finally a flag.  If
     the group contains no articles, the lowest article number should
     be reported as 1 and the highest as 0.

          active-file = *active-line
          active-line = name " " <number> " " <number> " " flags eol
          name        = <string>
          flags       = "n" / "y" / "m" / "x" / "j" / "=" name

     The flag says whether the group is read-only (`n'), is moderated
     (`m'), is dead (`x'), is aliased to some other group
     (`=other-group') or none of the above (`y').

`(nnchoke-request-post &optional SERVER)'
     This function should post the current buffer.  It might return
     whether the posting was successful or not, but that's not
     required.  If, for instance, the posting is done asynchronously,
     it has generally not been completed by the time this function
     concludes.  In that case, this function should set up some kind of
     sentinel to beep the user loud and clear if the posting could not
     be completed.

     There should be no result data from this function.

10.7.2.2 Optional Back End Functions
....................................

`(nnchoke-retrieve-groups GROUPS &optional SERVER)'
     GROUPS is a list of groups, and this function should request data
     on all those groups.  How it does it is of no concern to Gnus, but
     it should attempt to do this in a speedy fashion.

     The return value of this function can be either `active' or
     `group', which says what the format of the result data is.  The
     former is in the same format as the data from
     `nnchoke-request-list', while the latter is a buffer full of lines
     in the same format as `nnchoke-request-group' gives.

          group-buffer = *active-line / *group-status

`(nnchoke-request-update-info GROUP INFO &optional SERVER)'
     A Gnus group info (*note Group Info::) is handed to the back end
     for alterations.  This comes in handy if the back end really
     carries all the information (as is the case with virtual and imap
     groups).  This function should destructively alter the info to
     suit its needs, and should return a non-`nil' value.

     There should be no result data from this function.

`(nnchoke-request-type GROUP &optional ARTICLE)'
     When the user issues commands for "sending news" (`F' in the
     summary buffer, for instance), Gnus has to know whether the
     article the user is following up on is news or mail.  This
     function should return `news' if ARTICLE in GROUP is news, `mail'
     if it is mail and `unknown' if the type can't be decided.  (The
     ARTICLE parameter is necessary in `nnvirtual' groups which might
     very well combine mail groups and news groups.)  Both GROUP and
     ARTICLE may be `nil'.

     There should be no result data from this function.

`(nnchoke-request-set-mark GROUP ACTION &optional SERVER)'
     Set/remove/add marks on articles.  Normally Gnus handles the
     article marks (such as read, ticked, expired etc) internally, and
     store them in `~/.newsrc.eld'.  Some back ends (such as IMAP)
     however carry all information about the articles on the server, so
     Gnus need to propagate the mark information to the server.

     ACTION is a list of mark setting requests, having this format:

          (RANGE ACTION MARK)

     RANGE is a range of articles you wish to update marks on.  ACTION
     is `add' or `del', used to add marks or remove marks (preserving
     all marks not mentioned).  MARK is a list of marks; where each
     mark is a symbol.  Currently used marks are `read', `tick',
     `reply', `expire', `killed', `dormant', `save', `download',
     `unsend', `forward' and `recent', but your back end should, if
     possible, not limit itself to these.

     Given contradictory actions, the last action in the list should be
     the effective one.  That is, if your action contains a request to
     add the `tick' mark on article 1 and, later in the list, a request
     to remove the mark on the same article, the mark should in fact be
     removed.

     An example action list:

          (((5 12 30) 'del '(tick))
           ((10 . 90) 'add '(read expire))
           ((92 94) 'del '(read)))

     The function should return a range of articles it wasn't able to
     set the mark on (currently not used for anything).

     There should be no result data from this function.

`(nnchoke-request-update-mark GROUP ARTICLE MARK)'
     If the user tries to set a mark that the back end doesn't like,
     this function may change the mark.  Gnus will use whatever this
     function returns as the mark for ARTICLE instead of the original
     MARK.  If the back end doesn't care, it must return the original
     MARK, and not `nil' or any other type of garbage.

     The only use for this I can see is what `nnvirtual' does with
     it--if a component group is auto-expirable, marking an article as
     read in the virtual group should result in the article being
     marked as expirable.

     There should be no result data from this function.

`(nnchoke-request-scan &optional GROUP SERVER)'
     This function may be called at any time (by Gnus or anything else)
     to request that the back end check for incoming articles, in one
     way or another.  A mail back end will typically read the spool
     file or query the POP server when this function is invoked.  The
     GROUP doesn't have to be heeded--if the back end decides that it
     is too much work just scanning for a single group, it may do a
     total scan of all groups.  It would be nice, however, to keep
     things local if that's practical.

     There should be no result data from this function.

`(nnchoke-request-group-description GROUP &optional SERVER)'
     The result data from this function should be a description of
     GROUP.

          description-line = name <TAB> description eol
          name             = <string>
          description      = <text>

`(nnchoke-request-list-newsgroups &optional SERVER)'
     The result data from this function should be the description of all
     groups available on the server.

          description-buffer = *description-line

`(nnchoke-request-newgroups DATE &optional SERVER)'
     The result data from this function should be all groups that were
     created after `date', which is in normal human-readable date format
     (i.e., the date format used in mail and news headers, and returned
     by the function `message-make-date' by default).  The data should
     be in the active buffer format.

     It is okay for this function to return "too many" groups; some
     back ends might find it cheaper to return the full list of groups,
     rather than just the new groups.  But don't do this for back ends
     with many groups.  Normally, if the user creates the groups
     herself, there won't be too many groups, so `nnml' and the like
     are probably safe.  But for back ends like `nntp', where the
     groups have been created by the server, it is quite likely that
     there can be many groups.

`(nnchoke-request-create-group GROUP &optional SERVER)'
     This function should create an empty group with name GROUP.

     There should be no return data.

`(nnchoke-request-expire-articles ARTICLES &optional GROUP SERVER FORCE)'
     This function should run the expiry process on all articles in the
     ARTICLES range (which is currently a simple list of article
     numbers.)  It is left up to the back end to decide how old articles
     should be before they are removed by this function.  If FORCE is
     non-`nil', all ARTICLES should be deleted, no matter how new they
     are.

     This function should return a list of articles that it did not/was
     not able to delete.

     There should be no result data returned.

`(nnchoke-request-move-article ARTICLE GROUP SERVER ACCEPT-FORM &optional LAST)'
     This function should move ARTICLE (which is a number) from GROUP
     by calling ACCEPT-FORM.

     This function should ready the article in question for moving by
     removing any header lines it has added to the article, and
     generally should "tidy up" the article.  Then it should `eval'
     ACCEPT-FORM in the buffer where the "tidy" article is.  This will
     do the actual copying.  If this `eval' returns a non-`nil' value,
     the article should be removed.

     If LAST is `nil', that means that there is a high likelihood that
     there will be more requests issued shortly, so that allows some
     optimizations.

     The function should return a cons where the `car' is the group
     name and the `cdr' is the article number that the article was
     entered as.

     There should be no data returned.

`(nnchoke-request-accept-article GROUP &optional SERVER LAST)'
     This function takes the current buffer and inserts it into GROUP.
     If LAST in `nil', that means that there will be more calls to this
     function in short order.

     The function should return a cons where the `car' is the group
     name and the `cdr' is the article number that the article was
     entered as.

     The group should exist before the back end is asked to accept the
     article for that group.

     There should be no data returned.

`(nnchoke-request-replace-article ARTICLE GROUP BUFFER)'
     This function should remove ARTICLE (which is a number) from GROUP
     and insert BUFFER there instead.

     There should be no data returned.

`(nnchoke-request-delete-group GROUP FORCE &optional SERVER)'
     This function should delete GROUP.  If FORCE, it should really
     delete all the articles in the group, and then delete the group
     itself.  (If there is such a thing as "the group itself".)

     There should be no data returned.

`(nnchoke-request-rename-group GROUP NEW-NAME &optional SERVER)'
     This function should rename GROUP into NEW-NAME.  All articles in
     GROUP should move to NEW-NAME.

     There should be no data returned.



File: gnus,  Node: Error Messaging,  Next: Writing New Back Ends,  Prev: Optional Back End Functions,  Up: Back End Interface

10.7.2.3 Error Messaging
........................

The back ends should use the function `nnheader-report' to report error
conditions--they should not raise errors when they aren't able to
perform a request.  The first argument to this function is the back end
symbol, and the rest are interpreted as arguments to `format' if there
are multiple of them, or just a string if there is one of them.  This
function must always returns `nil'.

     (nnheader-report 'nnchoke "You did something totally bogus")

     (nnheader-report 'nnchoke "Could not request group %s" group)

   Gnus, in turn, will call `nnheader-get-report' when it gets a `nil'
back from a server, and this function returns the most recently
reported message for the back end in question.  This function takes one
argument--the server symbol.

   Internally, these functions access BACK-END`-status-string', so the
`nnchoke' back end will have its error message stored in
`nnchoke-status-string'.


File: gnus,  Node: Writing New Back Ends,  Next: Hooking New Back Ends Into Gnus,  Prev: Error Messaging,  Up: Back End Interface

10.7.2.4 Writing New Back Ends
..............................

Many back ends are quite similar.  `nnml' is just like `nnspool', but
it allows you to edit the articles on the server.  `nnmh' is just like
`nnml', but it doesn't use an active file, and it doesn't maintain
overview databases.  `nndir' is just like `nnml', but it has no concept
of "groups", and it doesn't allow editing articles.

   It would make sense if it were possible to "inherit" functions from
back ends when writing new back ends.  And, indeed, you can do that if
you want to.  (You don't have to if you don't want to, of course.)

   All the back ends declare their public variables and functions by
using a package called `nnoo'.

   To inherit functions from other back ends (and allow other back ends
to inherit functions from the current back end), you should use the
following macros:

`nnoo-declare'
     This macro declares the first parameter to be a child of the
     subsequent parameters.  For instance:

          (nnoo-declare nndir
            nnml nnmh)

     `nndir' has declared here that it intends to inherit functions from
     both `nnml' and `nnmh'.

`defvoo'
     This macro is equivalent to `defvar', but registers the variable as
     a public server variable.  Most state-oriented variables should be
     declared with `defvoo' instead of `defvar'.

     In addition to the normal `defvar' parameters, it takes a list of
     variables in the parent back ends to map the variable to when
     executing a function in those back ends.

          (defvoo nndir-directory nil
            "Where nndir will look for groups."
            nnml-current-directory nnmh-current-directory)

     This means that `nnml-current-directory' will be set to
     `nndir-directory' when an `nnml' function is called on behalf of
     `nndir'.  (The same with `nnmh'.)

`nnoo-define-basics'
     This macro defines some common functions that almost all back ends
     should have.

          (nnoo-define-basics nndir)

`deffoo'
     This macro is just like `defun' and takes the same parameters.  In
     addition to doing the normal `defun' things, it registers the
     function as being public so that other back ends can inherit it.

`nnoo-map-functions'
     This macro allows mapping of functions from the current back end to
     functions from the parent back ends.

          (nnoo-map-functions nndir
            (nnml-retrieve-headers 0 nndir-current-group 0 0)
            (nnmh-request-article 0 nndir-current-group 0 0))

     This means that when `nndir-retrieve-headers' is called, the first,
     third, and fourth parameters will be passed on to
     `nnml-retrieve-headers', while the second parameter is set to the
     value of `nndir-current-group'.

`nnoo-import'
     This macro allows importing functions from back ends.  It should
     be the last thing in the source file, since it will only define
     functions that haven't already been defined.

          (nnoo-import nndir
            (nnmh
             nnmh-request-list
             nnmh-request-newgroups)
            (nnml))

     This means that calls to `nndir-request-list' should just be passed
     on to `nnmh-request-list', while all public functions from `nnml'
     that haven't been defined in `nndir' yet should be defined now.


   Below is a slightly shortened version of the `nndir' back end.

10.7.2.5 Hooking New Back Ends Into Gnus
........................................

Having Gnus start using your new back end is rather easy--you just
declare it with the `gnus-declare-backend' functions.  This will enter
the back end into the `gnus-valid-select-methods' variable.

   `gnus-declare-backend' takes two parameters--the back end name and
an arbitrary number of "abilities".

   Here's an example:

     (gnus-declare-backend "nnchoke" 'mail 'respool 'address)

   The above line would then go in the `nnchoke.el' file.

   The abilities can be:

`mail'
     This is a mailish back end--followups should (probably) go via
     mail.

`post'
     This is a newsish back end--followups should (probably) go via
     news.

`post-mail'
     This back end supports both mail and news.

`none'
     This is neither a post nor mail back end--it's something completely
     different.

`respool'
     It supports respooling--or rather, it is able to modify its source
     articles and groups.

`address'
     The name of the server should be in the virtual server name.  This
     is true for almost all back ends.

`prompt-address'
     The user should be prompted for an address when doing commands like
     `B' in the group buffer.  This is true for back ends like `nntp',
     but not `nnmbox', for instance.


File: gnus,  Node: Mail-like Back Ends,  Prev: Hooking New Back Ends Into Gnus,  Up: Back End Interface

10.7.2.6 Mail-like Back Ends
............................

One of the things that separate the mail back ends from the rest of the
back ends is the heavy dependence by most of the mail back ends on
common functions in `nnmail.el'.  For instance, here's the definition
of `nnml-request-scan':

     (deffoo nnml-request-scan (&optional group server)
       (setq nnml-article-file-alist nil)
       (nnmail-get-new-mail 'nnml 'nnml-save-nov nnml-directory group))

   It simply calls `nnmail-get-new-mail' with a few parameters, and
`nnmail' takes care of all the moving and splitting of the mail.

   This function takes four parameters.

METHOD
     This should be a symbol to designate which back end is responsible
     for the call.

EXIT-FUNCTION
     This function should be called after the splitting has been
     performed.

TEMP-DIRECTORY
     Where the temporary files should be stored.

GROUP
     This optional argument should be a group name if the splitting is
     to be performed for one group only.

   `nnmail-get-new-mail' will call BACK-END`-save-mail' to save each
article.  BACK-END`-active-number' will be called to find the article
number assigned to this article.

   The function also uses the following variables:
BACK-END`-get-new-mail' (to see whether to get new mail for this back
end); and BACK-END`-group-alist' and BACK-END`-active-file' to generate
the new active file.  BACK-END`-group-alist' should be a group-active
alist, like this:

     (("a-group" (1 . 10))
      ("some-group" (34 . 39)))


File: gnus,  Node: Score File Syntax,  Next: Headers,  Prev: Back End Interface,  Up: Gnus Reference Guide

10.7.3 Score File Syntax
------------------------

Score files are meant to be easily parseable, but yet extremely
mallable.  It was decided that something that had the same read syntax
as an Emacs Lisp list would fit that spec.

   Here's a typical score file:

     (("summary"
       ("win95" -10000 nil s)
       ("Gnus"))
      ("from"
       ("Lars" -1000))
      (mark -100))

   BNF definition of a score file:

     score-file      = "" / "(" *element ")"
     element         = rule / atom
     rule            = string-rule / number-rule / date-rule
     string-rule     = "(" quote string-header quote space *string-match ")"
     number-rule     = "(" quote number-header quote space *number-match ")"
     date-rule       = "(" quote date-header quote space *date-match ")"
     quote           = <ascii 34>
     string-header   = "subject" / "from" / "references" / "message-id" /
                       "xref" / "body" / "head" / "all" / "followup"
     number-header   = "lines" / "chars"
     date-header     = "date"
     string-match    = "(" quote <string> quote [ "" / [ space score [ "" /
                       space date [ "" / [ space string-match-t ] ] ] ] ] ")"
     score           = "nil" / <integer>
     date            = "nil" / <natural number>
     string-match-t  = "nil" / "s" / "substring" / "S" / "Substring" /
                       "r" / "regex" / "R" / "Regex" /
                       "e" / "exact" / "E" / "Exact" /
                       "f" / "fuzzy" / "F" / "Fuzzy"
     number-match    = "(" <integer> [ "" / [ space score [ "" /
                       space date [ "" / [ space number-match-t ] ] ] ] ] ")"
     number-match-t  = "nil" / "=" / "<" / ">" / ">=" / "<="
     date-match      = "(" quote <string> quote [ "" / [ space score [ "" /
                       space date [ "" / [ space date-match-t ] ] ] ] ")"
     date-match-t    = "nil" / "at" / "before" / "after"
     atom            = "(" [ required-atom / optional-atom ] ")"
     required-atom   = mark / expunge / mark-and-expunge / files /
                       exclude-files / read-only / touched
     optional-atom   = adapt / local / eval
     mark            = "mark" space nil-or-number
     nil-or-number   = "nil" / <integer>
     expunge         = "expunge" space nil-or-number
     mark-and-expunge = "mark-and-expunge" space nil-or-number
     files           = "files" *[ space <string> ]
     exclude-files   = "exclude-files" *[ space <string> ]
     read-only       = "read-only" [ space "nil" / space "t" ]
     adapt        = "adapt" [ space "ignore" / space "t" / space adapt-rule ]
     adapt-rule      = "(" *[ <string> *[ "(" <string> <integer> ")" ] ")"
     local           = "local" *[ space "(" <string> space <form> ")" ]
     eval            = "eval" space <form>
     space           = *[ " " / <TAB> / <NEWLINE> ]

   Any unrecognized elements in a score file should be ignored, but not
discarded.

   As you can see, white space is needed, but the type and amount of
white space is irrelevant.  This means that formatting of the score
file is left up to the programmer--if it's simpler to just spew it all
out on one looong line, then that's ok.

   The meaning of the various atoms are explained elsewhere in this
manual (*note Score File Format::).


File: gnus,  Node: Headers,  Next: Ranges,  Prev: Score File Syntax,  Up: Gnus Reference Guide

10.7.4 Headers
--------------

Internally Gnus uses a format for storing article headers that
corresponds to the NOV format in a mysterious fashion.  One could
almost suspect that the author looked at the NOV specification and just
shamelessly _stole_ the entire thing, and one would be right.

   "Header" is a severely overloaded term.  "Header" is used in RFC
1036 to talk about lines in the head of an article (e.g., `From').  It
is used by many people as a synonym for "head"--"the header and the
body".  (That should be avoided, in my opinion.)  And Gnus uses a
format internally that it calls "header", which is what I'm talking
about here.  This is a 9-element vector, basically, with each header
(ouch) having one slot.

   These slots are, in order: `number', `subject', `from', `date',
`id', `references', `chars', `lines', `xref', and `extra'.  There are
macros for accessing and setting these slots--they all have predictable
names beginning with `mail-header-' and `mail-header-set-',
respectively.

   All these slots contain strings, except the `extra' slot, which
contains an alist of header/value pairs (*note To From Newsgroups::).


File: gnus,  Node: Ranges,  Next: Group Info,  Prev: Headers,  Up: Gnus Reference Guide

10.7.5 Ranges
-------------

GNUS introduced a concept that I found so useful that I've started
using it a lot and have elaborated on it greatly.

   The question is simple: If you have a large amount of objects that
are identified by numbers (say, articles, to take a _wild_ example)
that you want to qualify as being "included", a normal sequence isn't
very useful.  (A 200,000 length sequence is a bit long-winded.)

   The solution is as simple as the question: You just collapse the
sequence.

     (1 2 3 4 5 6 10 11 12)

   is transformed into

     ((1 . 6) (10 . 12))

   To avoid having those nasty `(13 . 13)' elements to denote a
lonesome object, a `13' is a valid element:

     ((1 . 6) 7 (10 . 12))

   This means that comparing two ranges to find out whether they are
equal is slightly tricky:

     ((1 . 5) 7 8 (10 . 12))

   and

     ((1 . 5) (7 . 8) (10 . 12))

   are equal.  In fact, any non-descending list is a range:

     (1 2 3 4 5)

   is a perfectly valid range, although a pretty long-winded one.  This
is also valid:

     (1 . 5)

   and is equal to the previous range.

   Here's a BNF definition of ranges.  Of course, one must remember the
semantic requirement that the numbers are non-descending.  (Any number
of repetition of the same number is allowed, but apt to disappear in
range handling.)

     range           = simple-range / normal-range
     simple-range    = "(" number " . " number ")"
     normal-range    = "(" start-contents ")"
     contents        = "" / simple-range *[ " " contents ] /
                       number *[ " " contents ]

   Gnus currently uses ranges to keep track of read articles and article
marks.  I plan on implementing a number of range operators in C if The
Powers That Be are willing to let me.  (I haven't asked yet, because I
need to do some more thinking on what operators I need to make life
totally range-based without ever having to convert back to normal
sequences.)


File: gnus,  Node: Group Info,  Next: Extended Interactive,  Prev: Ranges,  Up: Gnus Reference Guide

10.7.6 Group Info
-----------------

Gnus stores all permanent info on groups in a "group info" list.  This
list is from three to six elements (or more) long and exhaustively
describes the group.

   Here are two example group infos; one is a very simple group while
the second is a more complex one:

     ("no.group" 5 ((1 . 54324)))

     ("nnml:my.mail" 3 ((1 . 5) 9 (20 . 55))
                     ((tick (15 . 19)) (replied 3 6 (19 . 3)))
                     (nnml "")
                     ((auto-expire . t) (to-address . "ding@gnus.org")))

   The first element is the "group name"--as Gnus knows the group,
anyway.  The second element is the "subscription level", which normally
is a small integer.  (It can also be the "rank", which is a cons cell
where the `car' is the level and the `cdr' is the score.)  The third
element is a list of ranges of read articles.  The fourth element is a
list of lists of article marks of various kinds.  The fifth element is
the select method (or virtual server, if you like).  The sixth element
is a list of "group parameters", which is what this section is about.

   Any of the last three elements may be missing if they are not
required.  In fact, the vast majority of groups will normally only have
the first three elements, which saves quite a lot of cons cells.

   Here's a BNF definition of the group info format:

     info          = "(" group space ralevel space read
                     [ "" / [ space marks-list [ "" / [ space method [ "" /
                     space parameters ] ] ] ] ] ")"
     group         = quote <string> quote
     ralevel       = rank / level
     level         = <integer in the range of 1 to inf>
     rank          = "(" level "." score ")"
     score         = <integer in the range of 1 to inf>
     read          = range
     marks-lists   = nil / "(" *marks ")"
     marks         = "(" <string> range ")"
     method        = "(" <string> *elisp-forms ")"
     parameters    = "(" *elisp-forms ")"

   Actually that `marks' rule is a fib.  A `marks' is a `<string>'
consed on to a `range', but that's a bitch to say in pseudo-BNF.

   If you have a Gnus info and want to access the elements, Gnus offers
a series of macros for getting/setting these elements.

`gnus-info-group'
`gnus-info-set-group'
     Get/set the group name.

`gnus-info-rank'
`gnus-info-set-rank'
     Get/set the group rank (*note Group Score::).

`gnus-info-level'
`gnus-info-set-level'
     Get/set the group level.

`gnus-info-score'
`gnus-info-set-score'
     Get/set the group score (*note Group Score::).

`gnus-info-read'
`gnus-info-set-read'
     Get/set the ranges of read articles.

`gnus-info-marks'
`gnus-info-set-marks'
     Get/set the lists of ranges of marked articles.

`gnus-info-method'
`gnus-info-set-method'
     Get/set the group select method.

`gnus-info-params'
`gnus-info-set-params'
     Get/set the group parameters.

   All the getter functions take one parameter--the info list.  The
setter functions take two parameters--the info list and the new value.

   The last three elements in the group info aren't mandatory, so it
may be necessary to extend the group info before setting the element.
If this is necessary, you can just pass on a non-`nil' third parameter
to the three final setter functions to have this happen automatically.


File: gnus,  Node: Extended Interactive,  Next: Emacs/XEmacs Code,  Prev: Group Info,  Up: Gnus Reference Guide

10.7.7 Extended Interactive
---------------------------

Gnus extends the standard Emacs `interactive' specification slightly to
allow easy use of the symbolic prefix (*note Symbolic Prefixes::).
Here's an example of how this is used:

     (defun gnus-summary-increase-score (&optional score symp)
       (interactive (gnus-interactive "P\ny"))
       ...
       )

   The best thing to do would have been to implement `gnus-interactive'
as a macro which would have returned an `interactive' form, but this
isn't possible since Emacs checks whether a function is interactive or
not by simply doing an `assq' on the lambda form.  So, instead we have
`gnus-interactive' function that takes a string and returns values that
are usable to `interactive'.

   This function accepts (almost) all normal `interactive' specs, but
adds a few more.

`y'
     The current symbolic prefix--the `gnus-current-prefix-symbol'
     variable.

`Y'
     A list of the current symbolic prefixes--the
     `gnus-current-prefix-symbol' variable.

`A'
     The current article number--the `gnus-summary-article-number'
     function.

`H'
     The current article header--the `gnus-summary-article-header'
     function.

`g'
     The current group name--the `gnus-group-group-name' function.



File: gnus,  Node: Emacs/XEmacs Code,  Next: Various File Formats,  Prev: Extended Interactive,  Up: Gnus Reference Guide

10.7.8 Emacs/XEmacs Code
------------------------

While Gnus runs under Emacs, XEmacs and Mule, I decided that one of the
platforms must be the primary one.  I chose Emacs.  Not because I don't
like XEmacs or Mule, but because it comes first alphabetically.

   This means that Gnus will byte-compile under Emacs with nary a
warning, while XEmacs will pump out gigabytes of warnings while
byte-compiling.  As I use byte-compilation warnings to help me root out
trivial errors in Gnus, that's very useful.

   I've also consistently used Emacs function interfaces, but have used
Gnusey aliases for the functions.  To take an example:  Emacs defines a
`run-at-time' function while XEmacs defines a `start-itimer' function.
I then define a function called `gnus-run-at-time' that takes the same
parameters as the Emacs `run-at-time'.  When running Gnus under Emacs,
the former function is just an alias for the latter.  However, when
running under XEmacs, the former is an alias for the following function:

     (defun gnus-xmas-run-at-time (time repeat function &rest args)
       (start-itimer
        "gnus-run-at-time"
        `(lambda ()
           (,function ,@args))
        time repeat))

   This sort of thing has been done for bunches of functions.  Gnus does
not redefine any native Emacs functions while running under XEmacs--it
does this `defalias' thing with Gnus equivalents instead.  Cleaner all
over.

   In the cases where the XEmacs function interface was obviously
cleaner, I used it instead.  For example `gnus-region-active-p' is an
alias for `region-active-p' in XEmacs, whereas in Emacs it is a
function.

   Of course, I could have chosen XEmacs as my native platform and done
mapping functions the other way around.  But I didn't.  The performance
hit these indirections impose on Gnus under XEmacs should be slight.

The active file lists all groups available on the server in question.
It also lists the highest and lowest current article numbers in each
group.

   Here's an excerpt from a typical active file:

The newsgroups file lists groups along with their descriptions.  Not all
groups on the server have to be listed,  and not all groups in the file
have to exist on the server.  The file is meant purely as information to
the user.

   The format is quite simple; a group name, a tab, and the description.
Here's the definition:

     newsgroups    = *line
     line          = group tab description <NEWLINE>
     group         = <non-white-space string>

10.8 Emacs for Heathens
=======================

Believe it or not, but some people who use Gnus haven't really used
Emacs much before they embarked on their journey on the Gnus Love Boat.
If you are one of those unfortunates whom "`C-M-a'", "kill the region",
and "set `gnus-flargblossen' to an alist where the key is a regexp that
is used for matching on the group name" are magical phrases with little
or no meaning, then this appendix is for you.  If you are already
familiar with Emacs, just ignore this and go fondle your cat instead.

10.8.1 Keystrokes
-----------------

   * Q: What is an experienced Emacs user?

   * A: A person who wishes that the terminal had pedals.

   Yes, when you use Emacs, you are apt to use the control key, the
shift key and the meta key a lot.  This is very annoying to some people
(notably `vi'le users), and the rest of us just love the hell out of
it.  Just give up and submit.  Emacs really does stand for
"Escape-Meta-Alt-Control-Shift", and not "Editing Macros", as you may
have heard from other disreputable sources (like the Emacs author).

   The shift keys are normally located near your pinky fingers, and are
normally used to get capital letters and stuff.  You probably use it all
the time.  The control key is normally marked "CTRL" or something like
that.  The meta key is, funnily enough, never marked as such on any
keyboard.  The one I'm currently at has a key that's marked "Alt",
which is the meta key on this keyboard.  It's usually located somewhere
to the left hand side of the keyboard, usually on the bottom row.

   Now, us Emacs people don't say "press the meta-control-m key",
because that's just too inconvenient.  We say "press the `C-M-m' key".
`M-' is the prefix that means "meta" and "C-" is the prefix that means
"control".  So "press `C-k'" means "press down the control key, and
hold it down while you press `k'".  "Press `C-M-k'" means "press down
and hold down the meta key and the control key and then press `k'".
Simple, ay?

   This is somewhat complicated by the fact that not all keyboards have
a meta key.  In that case you can use the "escape" key.  Then `M-k'
means "press escape, release escape, press `k'".  That's much more work
than if you have a meta key, so if that's the case, I respectfully
suggest you get a real keyboard with a meta key.  You can't live without
it.

10.8.2 Emacs Lisp
-----------------

Emacs is the King of Editors because it's really a Lisp interpreter.
Each and every key you tap runs some Emacs Lisp code snippet, and since
Emacs Lisp is an interpreted language, that means that you can configure
any key to run any arbitrary code.  You just, like, do it.

   Gnus is written in Emacs Lisp, and is run as a bunch of interpreted
functions.  (These are byte-compiled for speed, but it's still
interpreted.)  If you decide that you don't like the way Gnus does
certain things, it's trivial to have it do something a different way.
(Well, at least if you know how to write Lisp code.)  However, that's
beyond the scope of this manual, so we are simply going to talk about
some common constructs that you normally use in your `~/.gnus.el' file
to customize Gnus.  (You can also use the `~/.emacs' file, but in order
to set things of Gnus up, it is much better to use the `~/.gnus.el'
file, *Note Startup Files::.)

   If you want to set the variable `gnus-florgbnize' to four (4), you
write the following:

     (setq gnus-florgbnize 4)

   This function (really "special form") `setq' is the one that can set
a variable to some value.  This is really all you need to know.  Now
you can go and fill your `~/.gnus.el' file with lots of these to change
how Gnus works.

   If you have put that thing in your `~/.gnus.el' file, it will be
read and `eval'ed (which is Lisp-ese for "run") the next time you start
Gnus.  If you want to change the variable right away, simply say `C-x
C-e' after the closing parenthesis.  That will `eval' the previous
"form", which is a simple `setq' statement here.

   Go ahead--just try it, if you're located at your Emacs.  After you
`C-x C-e', you will see `4' appear in the echo area, which is the
return value of the form you `eval'ed.

   Some pitfalls:

   If the manual says "set `gnus-read-active-file' to `some'", that
means:

     (setq gnus-read-active-file 'some)

   On the other hand, if the manual says "set `gnus-nntp-server' to
`nntp.ifi.uio.no'", that means:

     (setq gnus-nntp-server "nntp.ifi.uio.no")

   So be careful not to mix up strings (the latter) with symbols (the
former).  The manual is unambiguous, but it can be confusing.

Introduction
------------

This is the Gnus Frequently Asked Questions list.

   Gnus is a Usenet Newsreader and Electronic Mail User Agent
implemented as a part of Emacs. It's been around in some form for
almost a decade now, and has been distributed as a standard part of
Emacs for much of that time. Gnus 5 is the latest (and greatest)
incarnation. The original version was called GNUS, and was written by
Masanobu UMEDA.  When autumn crept up in '94, Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen
grew bored and decided to rewrite Gnus.

   Its biggest strength is the fact that it is extremely customizable.
It is somewhat intimidating at first glance, but most of the complexity
can be ignored until you're ready to take advantage of it. If you
receive a reasonable volume of e-mail (you're on various mailing
lists), or you would like to read high-volume mailing lists but cannot
keep up with them, or read high volume newsgroups or are just bored,
then Gnus is what you want.

   This FAQ was maintained by Justin Sheehy until March 2002. He would
like to thank Steve Baur and Per Abrahamsen for doing a wonderful job
with this FAQ before him. We would like to do the same - thanks, Justin!

   If you have a Web browser, the official hypertext version is at:
`http://my.gnus.org/FAQ/'.  This version is much nicer than the
unofficial hypertext versions that are archived at Utrecht, Oxford,
Smart Pages, Ohio State, and other FAQ archives. See the resources
question below if you want information on obtaining it in another
format.

   The information contained here was compiled with the assistance of
the Gnus development mailing list, and any errors or misprints are the
my.gnus.org team's fault, sorry.

File: gnus,  Node: [1.1],  Next: [1.2],  Up: FAQ 1 - Installation FAQ

Question 1.1
............

What is the latest version of Gnus?

Answer
......

Jingle please: Gnus 5.10 is released, get it while it's hot! As well as
the step in version number is rather small, Gnus 5.10 has tons of new
features which you shouldn't miss. The current release (5.10.8) should
be at least as stable as the latest release of the 5.8 series.


File: gnus,  Node: [1.2],  Next: [1.3],  Prev: [1.1],  Up: FAQ 1 - Installation FAQ

Question 1.2
............

What's new in 5.10?

Answer
......

First of all, you should have a look into the file GNUS-NEWS in the
toplevel directory of the Gnus tarball, there the most important
changes are listed. Here's a short list of the changes I find especially
important/interesting:

   * Major rewrite of the Gnus agent, Gnus agent is now active by
     default.

   * Many new article washing functions for dealing with ugly formatted
     articles.

   * Anti Spam features.

   * Message-utils now included in Gnus.

   * New format specifiers for summary lines, e.g. %B for a complex
     trn-style thread tree.


File: gnus,  Node: [1.3],  Next: [1.4],  Prev: [1.2],  Up: FAQ 1 - Installation FAQ

Question 1.3
............

Where and how to get Gnus?

Answer
......

The latest released version of Gnus isn't included in Emacs 21,
therefor you should get the Gnus tarball from
`http://www.gnus.org/dist/gnus.tar.gz' or via anonymous FTP from
`ftp://ftp.gnus.org/pub/gnus/gnus.tar.gz'.  If you use XEmacs instead
of Emacs you can use XEmacs' package system instead.


File: gnus,  Node: [1.4],  Next: [1.5],  Prev: [1.3],  Up: FAQ 1 - Installation FAQ

Question 1.4
............

What to do with the tarball now?

Answer
......

Untar it via `tar xvzf gnus.tar.gz' and do the common `./configure;
make; make install' circle.  (under MS-Windows either get the Cygwin
environment from `http://www.cygwin.com' which allows you to do what's
described above or unpack the tarball with some packer (e.g. Winace from
`http://www.winace.com') and use the batch-file make.bat included in
the tarball to install Gnus.) If you don't want to (or aren't allowed
to) install Gnus system-wide, you can install it in your home directory
and add the following lines to your ~/.xemacs/init.el or ~/.emacs:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/gnus/lisp")
     (if (featurep 'xemacs)
         (add-to-list 'Info-directory-list "/path/to/gnus/texi/")
       (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "/path/to/gnus/texi/"))
   Make sure that you don't have any Gnus related stuff before this
line, on MS Windows use something like "C:/path/to/lisp" (yes, "/").

Question 1.5
............

I sometimes read references to No Gnus and Oort Gnus, what are those?

Answer
......

Oort Gnus was the name of the development version of Gnus, which became
Gnus 5.10 in autumn 2003. No Gnus is the name of the current
development version which will once become Gnus 5.12 or Gnus 6. (If
you're wondering why not 5.11, the odd version numbers are normally
used for the Gnus versions bundled with Emacs)


File: gnus,  Node: [1.6],  Next: [1.7],  Prev: [1.5],  Up: FAQ 1 - Installation FAQ

Question 1.6
............

Which version of Emacs do I need?

Answer
......

Gnus 5.10 requires an Emacs version that is greater than or equal to
Emacs 20.7 or XEmacs 21.1.  The development versions of Gnus (aka No
Gnus) requires Emacs 21 or XEmacs 21.4.


File: gnus,  Node: [1.7],  Prev: [1.6],  Up: FAQ 1 - Installation FAQ

Question 1.7
............

How do I run Gnus on both Emacs and XEmacs?

Answer
......

You can't use the same copy of Gnus in both as the Lisp files are
byte-compiled to a format which is different depending on which Emacs
did the compilation. Get one copy of Gnus for Emacs and one for XEmacs.

File: gnus,  Node: [2.1],  Next: [2.2],  Up: FAQ 2 - Startup / Group buffer

Question 2.1
............

Every time I start Gnus I get a message "Gnus auto-save file exists. Do
you want to read it?", what does this mean and how to prevent it?

Answer
......

This message means that the last time you used Gnus, it wasn't properly
exited and therefor couldn't write its informations to disk (e.g. which
messages you read), you are now asked if you want to restore those
informations from the auto-save file.

   To prevent this message make sure you exit Gnus via `q' in group
buffer instead of just killing Emacs.


File: gnus,  Node: [2.2],  Next: [2.3],  Prev: [2.1],  Up: FAQ 2 - Startup / Group buffer

Question 2.2
............

Gnus doesn't remember which groups I'm subscribed to, what's this?

Answer
......

You get the message described in the q/a pair above while starting
Gnus, right? It's an other symptom for the same problem, so read the
answer above.

Question 2.3
............

How to change the format of the lines in Group buffer?

Answer
......

You've got to tweak the value of the variable gnus-group-line-format.
See the manual node "Group Line Specification" for information on how
to do this. An example for this (guess from whose .gnus :-)):

     (setq gnus-group-line-format "%P%M%S[%5t]%5y : %(%g%)\n")


File: gnus,  Node: [2.4],  Next: [2.5],  Prev: [2.3],  Up: FAQ 2 - Startup / Group buffer

Question 2.4
............

My group buffer becomes a bit crowded, is there a way to sort my groups
into categories so I can easier browse through them?

Answer
......

Gnus offers the topic mode, it allows you to sort your groups in, well,
topics, e.g. all groups dealing with Linux under the topic linux, all
dealing with music under the topic music and all dealing with scottish
music under the topic scottish which is a subtopic of music.

   To enter topic mode, just hit t while in Group buffer. Now you can
use `T n' to create a topic at point and `T m' to move a group to a
specific topic. For more commands see the manual or the menu. You might
want to include the %P specifier at the beginning of your
gnus-group-line-format variable to have the groups nicely indented.

Question 2.5
............

How to manually sort the groups in Group buffer? How to sort the groups
in a topic?

Answer
......

Move point over the group you want to move and hit `C-k', now move
point to the place where you want the group to be and hit `C-y'.

Question 3.1
............

I just installed Gnus, started it via `M-x gnus' but it only says "nntp
(news) open error", what to do?

Answer
......

You've got to tell Gnus where to fetch the news from. Read the
documentation for information on how to do this. As a first start, put
those lines in ~/.gnus.el:

     (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.yourprovider.net"))
     (setq user-mail-address "you@yourprovider.net")
     (setq user-full-name "Your Name")


File: gnus,  Node: [3.2],  Next: [3.3],  Prev: [3.1],  Up: FAQ 3 - Getting Messages

Question 3.2
............

I'm working under Windows and have no idea what ~/.gnus.el means.

Answer
......

The ~/ means the home directory where Gnus and Emacs look for the
configuration files.  However, you don't really need to know what this
means, it suffices that Emacs knows what it means :-) You can type `C-x
C-f ~/.gnus.el RET ' (yes, with the forward slash, even on Windows), and
Emacs will open the right file for you.  (It will most likely be new,
and thus empty.)  However, I'd discourage you from doing so, since the
directory Emacs chooses will most certainly not be what you want, so
let's do it the correct way.  The first thing you've got to do is to
create a suitable directory (no blanks in directory name please) e.g.
c:\myhome. Then you must set the environment variable HOME to this
directory.  To do this under Win9x or Me include the line

     SET HOME=C:\myhome
   in your autoexec.bat and reboot.  Under NT, 2000 and XP, hit
Winkey+Pause/Break to enter system options (if it doesn't work, go to
Control Panel -> System). There you'll find the possibility to set
environment variables, create a new one with name HOME and value
C:\myhome, a reboot is not necessary.

   Now to create ~/.gnus.el, say `C-x C-f ~/.gnus.el RET C-x C-s'.  in
Emacs.

Question 3.3
............

My news server requires authentication, how to store user name and
password on disk?

Answer
......

Create a file ~/.authinfo which includes for each server a line like
this

     machine news.yourprovider.net login YourUserName password YourPassword
   .  Make sure that the file isn't readable to others if you work on a
OS which is capable of doing so.  (Under Unix say
     chmod 600 ~/.authinfo
   in a shell.)

Question 3.4
............

Gnus seems to start up OK, but I can't find out how to subscribe to a
group.

Answer
......

If you know the name of the group say `U name.of.group RET' in group
buffer (use the tab-completion Luke). Otherwise hit ^ in group buffer,
this brings you to the server buffer. Now place point (the cursor) over
the server which carries the group you want, hit `RET', move point to
the group you want to subscribe to and say `u' to subscribe to it.

Question 3.5
............

Gnus doesn't show all groups / Gnus says I'm not allowed to post on
this server as well as I am, what's that?

Answer
......

Some providers allow restricted anonymous access and full access only
after authorization. To make Gnus send authinfo to those servers append

     force yes
   to the line for those servers in ~/.authinfo.

Question 3.6
............

I want Gnus to fetch news from several servers, is this possible?

Answer
......

Of course. You can specify more sources for articles in the variable
gnus-secondary-select-methods. Add something like this in ~/.gnus.el:

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods
                  '(nntp "news.yourSecondProvider.net"))
     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods
                  '(nntp "news.yourThirdProvider.net"))


File: gnus,  Node: [3.7],  Next: [3.8],  Prev: [3.6],  Up: FAQ 3 - Getting Messages

Question 3.7
............

And how about local spool files?

Answer
......

No problem, this is just one more select method called nnspool, so you
want this:

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnspool ""))
   Or this if you don't want an NNTP Server as primary news source:

     (setq gnus-select-method '(nnspool ""))
   Gnus will look for the spool file in /usr/spool/news, if you want
something different, change the line above to something like this:

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods
                  '(nnspool ""
     		       (nnspool-directory "/usr/local/myspoolddir")))
   This sets the spool directory for this server only.  You might have
to specify more stuff like the program used to post articles, see the
Gnus manual on how to do this.


File: gnus,  Node: [3.8],  Next: [3.9],  Prev: [3.7],  Up: FAQ 3 - Getting Messages

Question 3.8
............

OK, reading news works now, but I want to be able to read my mail with
Gnus, too. How to do it?

Answer
......

That's a bit harder since there are many possible sources for mail,
many possible ways for storing mail and many different ways for sending
mail. The most common cases are these: 1: You want to read your mail
from a pop3 server and send them directly to a SMTP Server 2: Some
program like fetchmail retrieves your mail and stores it on disk from
where Gnus shall read it. Outgoing mail is sent by Sendmail, Postfix or
some other MTA. Sometimes, you even need a combination of the above
cases.

   However, the first thing to do is to tell Gnus in which way it
should store the mail, in Gnus terminology which back end to use. Gnus
supports many different back ends, the most commonly used one is nnml.
It stores every mail in one file and is therefor quite fast. However
you might prefer a one file per group approach if your file system has
problems with many small files, the nnfolder back end is then probably
the choice for you.  To use nnml add the following to ~/.gnus.el:

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnml ""))
   As you might have guessed, if you want nnfolder, it's

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnfolder ""))
   Now we need to tell Gnus, where to get it's mail from. If it's a
POP3 server, then you need something like this:

     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(pop :server "pop.YourProvider.net"
                                         :user "yourUserName"
                                         :password "yourPassword")))
   Make sure ~/.gnus.el isn't readable to others if you store your
password there. If you want to read your mail from a traditional spool
file on your local machine, it's

     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(file :path "/path/to/spool/file"))
   If it's a Maildir, with one file per message as used by postfix,
Qmail and (optionally) fetchmail it's

     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(maildir :path "/path/to/Maildir/"
                                             :subdirs ("cur" "new")))
   And finally if you want to read your mail from several files in one
directory, for example because procmail already split your mail, it's

     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources
     		'(directory :path "/path/to/procmail-dir/"
     			    :suffix ".prcml")))
   Where :suffix ".prcml" tells Gnus only to use files with the suffix
.prcml.

   OK, now you only need to tell Gnus how to send mail. If you want to
send mail via sendmail (or whichever MTA is playing the role of
sendmail on your system), you don't need to do anything. However, if
you want to send your mail to an SMTP Server you need the following in
your ~/.gnus.el

     (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     (setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.yourProvider.net")

Question 3.9
............

And what about IMAP?

Answer
......

There are two ways of using IMAP with Gnus. The first one is to use
IMAP like POP3, that means Gnus fetches the mail from the IMAP server
and stores it on disk. If you want to do this (you don't really want to
do this) add the following to ~/.gnus.el

     (add-to-list 'mail-sources '(imap :server "mail.mycorp.com"
                                       :user "username"
                                       :pass "password"
                                       :stream network
                                       :authentication login
                                       :mailbox "INBOX"
                                       :fetchflag "\\Seen"))
   You might have to tweak the values for stream and/or
authentification, see the Gnus manual node "Mail Source Specifiers" for
possible values.

   If you want to use IMAP the way it's intended, you've got to follow
a different approach.  You've got to add the nnimap back end to your
select method and give the information about the server there.

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods
     	     '(nnimap "Give the baby a name"
     		      (nnimap-address "imap.yourProvider.net")
     		      (nnimap-port 143)
     		      (nnimap-list-pattern "archive.*")))
   Again, you might have to specify how to authenticate to the server
if Gnus can't guess the correct way, see the Manual Node "IMAP" for
detailed information.

Question 3.10
.............

At the office we use one of those MS Exchange servers, can I use Gnus
to read my mail from it?

Answer
......

Offer your administrator a pair of new running shoes for activating
IMAP on the server and follow the instructions above.


File: gnus,  Node: [3.11],  Prev: [3.10],  Up: FAQ 3 - Getting Messages

Question 3.11
.............

Can I tell Gnus not to delete the mails on the server it retrieves via
POP3?

Answer
......

First of all, that's not the way POP3 is intended to work, if you have
the possibility, you should use the IMAP Protocol if you want your
messages to stay on the server. Nevertheless there might be situations
where you need the feature, but sadly Gnus itself has no predefined
functionality to do so.

   However this is Gnus county so there are possibilities to achieve
what you want. The easiest way is to get an external program which
retrieves copies of the mail and stores them on disk, so Gnus can read
it from there. On Unix systems you could use e.g. fetchmail for this,
on MS Windows you can use Hamster, an excellent local news and mail
server.

   The other solution would be, to replace the method Gnus uses to get
mail from POP3 servers by one which is capable of leaving the mail on
the server. If you use XEmacs, get the package mail-lib, it includes an
enhanced pop3.el, look in the file, there's documentation on how to tell
Gnus to use it and not to delete the retrieved mail. For GNU Emacs look
for the file epop3.el which can do the same (If you know the home of
this file, please send me an e-mail). You can also tell Gnus to use an
external program (e.g. fetchmail) to fetch your mail, see the info node
"Mail Source Specifiers" in the Gnus manual on how to do it.

Question 4.1
............

When I enter a group, all read messages are gone. How to view them
again?

Answer
......

If you enter the group by saying `RET' in group buffer with point over
the group, only unread and ticked messages are loaded. Say `C-u RET'
instead to load all available messages. If you want only the e.g. 300
newest say `C-u 300 RET'

   Loading only unread messages can be annoying if you have threaded
view enabled, say

     (setq gnus-fetch-old-headers 'some)
   in ~/.gnus.el to load enough old articles to prevent teared threads,
replace 'some with t to load all articles (Warning: Both settings
enlarge the amount of data which is fetched when you enter a group and
slow down the process of entering a group).

   If you already use Gnus 5.10, you can say `/o N' In summary buffer
to load the last N messages, this feature is not available in 5.8.8

   If you don't want all old messages, but the parent of the message
you're just reading, you can say `^', if you want to retrieve the whole
thread the message you're just reading belongs to, `A T' is your friend.

How to tell Gnus to show an important message every time I enter a
group, even when it's read?

Answer

You can tick important messages. To do this hit `u' while point is in

either `d' (this deletes the tick mark and set's unread mark) or `M c'
(which deletes all marks for the message).

Question 4.5
............

How can I change the headers Gnus displays by default at the top of the

Answer

The variable gnus-visible-headers controls which headers are shown, its
value is a regular expression, header lines which match it are shown.
So if you want author, subject, date, and if the header exists,
Followup-To and MUA / NUA say this in ~/.gnus.el:

     (setq gnus-visible-headers
           '("^From" "^Subject" "^Date" "^Newsgroups" "^Followup-To"
     	"^User-Agent" "^X-Newsreader" "^X-Mailer"))

Question 4.8
............

Is there anything I can do to make poorly formatted mails more readable?

Answer
......

Gnus offers you several functions to "wash" incoming mail, you can find
them if you browse through the menu, item Article->Washing. The most
interesting ones are probably "Wrap long lines" (`W w'), "Decode ROT13"
(`W r') and "Outlook Deuglify" which repairs the dumb quoting used by
many users of Microsoft products (`W Y f' gives you full deuglify.  See
`W Y C-h' or have a look at the menus for other deuglifications).
Outlook deuglify is only available since Gnus 5.10.

Question 4.9
............

Is there a way to automatically ignore posts by specific authors or
with specific words in the subject? And can I highlight more
interesting ones in some way?

Answer
......

You want Scoring. Scoring means, that you define rules which assign
each message an integer value. Depending on the value the message is
highlighted in summary buffer (if it's high, say +2000) or
automatically marked read (if the value is low, say -800) or some other
action happens.

   There are basically three ways of setting up rules which assign the
scoring-value to messages. The first and easiest way is to set up rules
based on the article you are just reading. Say you're reading a message
by a guy who always writes nonsense and you want to ignore his messages
in the future. Hit `L', to set up a rule which lowers the score.  Now
Gnus asks you which the criteria for lowering the Score shall be. Hit
`?' twice to see all possibilities, we want `a' which means the author
(the from header). Now Gnus wants to know which kind of matching we
want.  Hit either `e' for an exact match or `s' for substring-match and
delete afterwards everything but the name to score down all authors
with the given name no matter which email address is used. Now you need
to tell Gnus when to apply the rule and how long it should last, hit
e.g.  `p' to apply the rule now and let it last forever. If you want to
raise the score instead of lowering it say `I' instead of `L'.

   You can also set up rules by hand. To do this say `V f' in summary
buffer. Then you are asked for the name of the score file, it's
name.of.group.SCORE for rules valid in only one group or all.Score for
rules valid in all groups. See the Gnus manual for the exact syntax,
basically it's one big list whose elements are lists again. the first
element of those lists is the header to score on, then one more list
with what to match, which score to assign, when to expire the rule and
how to do the matching. If you find me very interesting, you could e.g.
add the following to your all.Score:

     (("references" ("hschmi22.userfqdn.rz-online.de" 500 nil s))
      ("message-id" ("hschmi22.userfqdn.rz-online.de" 999 nil s)))
   This would add 999 to the score of messages written by me and 500 to
the score of messages which are a (possibly indirect) answer to a
message written by me. Of course nobody with a sane mind would do this
:-)

   The third alternative is adaptive scoring. This means Gnus watches
you and tries to find out what you find interesting and what annoying
and sets up rules which reflect this. Adaptive scoring can be a huge
help when reading high traffic groups. If you want to activate adaptive
scoring say

     (setq gnus-use-adaptive-scoring t)
   in ~/.gnus.el.

Question 4.10
.............

How can I disable threading in some (e.g. mail-) groups, or set other
variables specific for some groups?

Answer
......

While in group buffer move point over the group and hit `G c', this
opens a buffer where you can set options for the group. At the bottom
of the buffer you'll find an item that allows you to set variables
locally for the group. To disable threading enter gnus-show-threads as
name of variable and nil as value. Hit button done at the top of the
buffer when you're ready.

Answer

Stop those "Can I ..." questions, the answer is always yes in Gnus
Country :-). It's a three step process: First we make faces
(specifications of how summary-line shall look like) for those
postings, then we'll give them some special score and finally we'll
tell Gnus to use the new faces. You can find detailed instructions on
how to do it on my.gnus.org (http://my.gnus.org/node/view/224)

Question 4.12
.............

The number of total messages in a group which Gnus displays in group
buffer is by far to high, especially in mail groups. Is this a bug?

Answer
......

No, that's a matter of design of Gnus, fixing this would mean
reimplementation of major parts of Gnus' back ends. Gnus thinks
"highest-article-number - lowest-article-number =
total-number-of-articles". This works OK for Usenet groups, but if you
delete and move many messages in mail groups, this fails. To cure the
symptom, enter the group via `C-u RET' (this makes Gnus get all
messages), then hit `M P b' to mark all messages and then say `B m
name.of.group' to move all messages to the group they have been in
before, they get new message numbers in this process and the count is
right again (until you delete and move your mail to other groups again).

Question 4.13
.............

I don't like the layout of summary and article buffer, how to change
it? Perhaps even a three pane display?

Answer
......

You can control the windows configuration by calling the function
gnus-add-configuration. The syntax is a bit complicated but explained
very well in the manual node "Window Layout". Some popular examples:

   Instead 25% summary 75% article buffer 35% summary and 65% article
(the 1.0 for article means "take the remaining space"):

     (gnus-add-configuration
      '(article (vertical 1.0 (summary .35 point) (article 1.0))))
   A three pane layout, Group buffer on the left, summary buffer
top-right, article buffer bottom-right:

     (gnus-add-configuration
      '(article
        (horizontal 1.0
     	       (vertical 25
     			 (group 1.0))
     	       (vertical 1.0
     			 (summary 0.25 point)
     			 (article 1.0)))))
     (gnus-add-configuration
      '(summary
        (horizontal 1.0
     	       (vertical 25
     			 (group 1.0))
     	       (vertical 1.0

Question 4.14
.............

I don't like the way the Summary buffer looks, how to tweak it?

Answer
......

You've got to play around with the variable gnus-summary-line-format.
It's value is a string of symbols which stand for things like author,
date, subject etc. A list of the available specifiers can be found in
the manual node "Summary Buffer Lines" and the often forgotten node
"Formatting Variables" and it's sub-nodes. There you'll find useful
things like positioning the cursor and tabulators which allow you a
summary in table form, but sadly hard tabulators are broken in 5.8.8.

   Since 5.10, Gnus offers you some very nice new specifiers, e.g. %B
which draws a thread-tree and %&user-date which gives you a date where
the details are dependent of the articles age. Here's an example which
uses both:

     (setq gnus-summary-line-format ":%U%R %B %s %-60=|%4L |%-20,20f |%&user-date; \n")
   resulting in:

Question 4.15
.............

How to split incoming mails in several groups?

Answer
......

Gnus offers two possibilities for splitting mail, the easy
nnmail-split-methods and the more powerful Fancy Mail Splitting. I'll
only talk about the first one, refer to the manual, node "Fancy Mail
Splitting" for the latter.

   The value of nnmail-split-methods is a list, each element is a list
which stands for a splitting rule. Each rule has the form "group where
matching articles should go to", "regular expression which has to be
matched", the first rule which matches wins. The last rule must always
be a general rule (regular expression .*) which denotes where articles
should go which don't match any other rule. If the folder doesn't exist
yet, it will be created as soon as an article lands there.  By default
the mail will be send to all groups whose rules match. If you don't
want that (you probably don't want), say

     (setq nnmail-crosspost nil)
   in ~/.gnus.el.

   An example might be better than thousand words, so here's my
nnmail-split-methods. Note that I send duplicates in a special group
and that the default group is spam, since I filter all mails out which
are from some list I'm subscribed to or which are addressed directly to
me before. Those rules kill about 80% of the Spam which reaches me
(Email addresses are changed to prevent spammers from using them):

     (setq nnmail-split-methods
       '(("duplicates" "^Gnus-Warning:.*duplicate")
         ("XEmacs-NT" "^\\(To:\\|CC:\\).*localpart@xemacs.invalid.*")

Question 5.1
............

What are the basic commands I need to know for sending mail and
postings?

Answer
......

To start composing a new mail hit `m' either in Group or Summary
buffer, for a posting, it's either `a' in Group buffer and filling the
Newsgroups header manually or `a' in the Summary buffer of the group
where the posting shall be send to. Replying by mail is `r' if you
don't want to cite the author, or import the cited text manually and
`R' to cite the text of the original message. For a follow up to a
newsgroup, it's `f' and `F' (analogously to `r' and `R').

   Enter new headers above the line saying "-text follows this line-",
enter the text below the line. When ready hit `C-c C-c', to send the
message, if you want to finish it later hit `C-c C-d' to save it in the
drafts group, where you can start editing it again by saying `D e'.

Question 5.2
............

How to enable automatic word-wrap when composing messages?

Answer
......

Say

     (add-hook 'message-mode-hook
     	  (lambda ()
     	    (setq fill-column 72)
     	    (turn-on-auto-fill)))
   in ~/.gnus.el. You can reformat a paragraph by hitting `M-q' (as
usual)

Question 5.3
............

How to set stuff like From, Organization, Reply-To, signature...?

Answer
......

There are other ways, but you should use posting styles for this. (See
below why).  This example should make the syntax clear:

     (setq gnus-posting-styles
       '((".*"
          (name "Frank Schmitt")
          (address "me@there.invalid")
          (organization "Hamme net, kren mer och nimmi")
          (signature-file "~/.signature")
          ("X-SampleHeader" "foobar")
          (eval (setq some-variable "Foo bar")))))
   The ".*" means that this settings are the default ones (see below),
valid values for the first element of the following lists are
signature, signature-file, organization, address, name or body.  The
attribute name can also be a string.  In that case, this will be used as
a header name, and the value will be inserted in the headers of the
article; if the value is `nil', the header name will be removed. You
can also say (eval (foo bar)), then the function foo will be evaluated
with argument bar and the result will be thrown away.


File: gnus,  Node: [5.4],  Next: [5.5],  Prev: [5.3],  Up: FAQ 5 - Composing messages

Question 5.4
............

Can I set things like From, Signature etc group based on the group I
post too?

Answer
......

That's the strength of posting styles. Before, we used ".*" to set the
default for all groups. You can use a regexp like "^gmane" and the
following settings are only applied to postings you send to the gmane
hierarchy, use ".*binaries" instead and they will be applied to postings
send to groups containing the string binaries in their name etc.

   You can instead of specifying a regexp specify a function which is
evaluated, only if it returns true, the corresponding settings take
effect. Two interesting candidates for this are message-news-p which
returns t if the current Group is a newsgroup and the corresponding
message-mail-p.

   Note that all forms that match are applied, that means in the
example below, when I post to gmane.mail.spam.spamassassin.general, the
settings under ".*" are applied and the settings under message-news-p
and those under "^gmane" and those under
"^gmane\\.mail\\.spam\\.spamassassin\\.general$". Because of this put
general settings at the top and specific ones at the bottom.

     (setq gnus-posting-styles
           '((".*" ;;default
              (name "Frank Schmitt")
              (organization "Hamme net, kren mer och nimmi")
              (signature-file "~/.signature"))
             ((message-news-p) ;;Usenet news?
              (address "mySpamTrap@Frank-Schmitt.invalid")
              (reply-to "hereRealRepliesOnlyPlease@Frank-Schmitt.invalid"))
             ((message-mail-p) ;;mail?
              (address "usedForMails@Frank-Schmitt.invalid"))
             ("^gmane" ;;this is mail, too in fact
              (address "usedForMails@Frank-Schmitt.invalid")
              (reply-to nil))
             ("^gmane\\.mail\\.spam\\.spamassassin\\.general$"
              (eval (set (make-local-variable 'message-sendmail-envelope-from)
                         "Azzrael@rz-online.de")))))

Question 5.5
............

Is there a spell-checker? Perhaps even on-the-fly spell-checking?

Answer
......

You can use ispell.el to spell-check stuff in Emacs. So the first thing
to do is to make sure that you've got either ispell
(http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/fmg-members/geoff/ispell.html) or aspell
(http://aspell.sourceforge.net/) installed and in your Path. Then you
need ispell.el (http://www.kdstevens.com/~stevens/ispell-page.html) and
for on-the-fly spell-checking flyspell.el
(http://www-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/personnel/Manuel.Serrano/flyspell/flyspell.html).
Ispell.el is shipped with Emacs and available through the XEmacs
package system, flyspell.el is shipped with Emacs and part of XEmacs
text-modes package which is available through the package system, so
there should be no need to install them manually.

   Ispell.el assumes you use ispell, if you choose aspell say

     (setq ispell-program-name "aspell")
   in your Emacs configuration file.

   If you want your outgoing messages to be spell-checked, say

     (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'ispell-message)
   In your ~/.gnus.el, if you prefer on-the-fly spell-checking say

     (add-hook 'message-mode-hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode 1)))

Question 5.6
............

Can I set the dictionary based on the group I'm posting to?

Answer
......

Yes, say something like

     (add-hook 'gnus-select-group-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (cond
                  ((string-match
                    "^de\\." (gnus-group-real-name gnus-newsgroup-name))
                   (ispell-change-dictionary "deutsch8"))
                  (t
                   (ispell-change-dictionary "english")))))
   in ~/.gnus.el. Change "^de\\." and "deutsch8" to something that
suits your needs.

Question 5.7
............

Is there some kind of address-book, so I needn't remember all those
email addresses?

Answer
......

There's an very basic solution for this, mail aliases.  You can store
your mail addresses in a ~/.mailrc file using a simple alias syntax:

     alias al	"Al <al@english-heritage.invalid>"
   Then typing your alias (followed by a space or punctuation
character) on a To: or Cc: line in the message buffer will cause Gnus
to insert the full address for you. See the node "Mail Aliases" in
Message (not Gnus) manual for details.

   However, what you really want is the Insidious Big Brother Database
bbdb. Get it through the XEmacs package system or from bbdb's homepage
(http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/).  Now place the following in ~/.gnus.el,
to activate bbdb for Gnus:

     (require 'bbdb)
     (bbdb-initialize 'gnus 'message)
   Now you probably want some general bbdb configuration, place them in
~/.emacs:

     (require 'bbdb)
     ;;If you don't live in Northern America, you should disable the
     ;;syntax check for telephone numbers by saying
     (setq bbdb-north-american-phone-numbers-p nil)
     ;;Tell bbdb about your email address:
     (setq bbdb-user-mail-names
           (regexp-opt '("Your.Email@here.invalid"
                         "Your.other@mail.there.invalid")))
     ;;cycling while completing email addresses
     (setq bbdb-complete-name-allow-cycling t)
     ;;No popup-buffers
     (setq bbdb-use-pop-up nil)
   Now you should be ready to go. Say `M-x bbdb RET RET' to open a bbdb
buffer showing all entries. Say `c' to create a new entry, `b' to
search your BBDB and `C-o' to add a new field to an entry. If you want
to add a sender to the BBDB you can also just hit `:' on the posting in
the summary buffer and you are done. When you now compose a new mail,
hit `TAB' to cycle through know recipients.

Question 5.8
............

Sometimes I see little images at the top of article buffer. What's that
and how can I send one with my postings, too?

Answer
......

Those images are called X-Faces. They are 48*48 pixel b/w pictures,
encoded in a header line. If you want to include one in your posts,
you've got to convert some image to a X-Face. So fire up some image
manipulation program (say Gimp), open the image you want to include,
cut out the relevant part, reduce color depth to 1 bit, resize to 48*48
and save as bitmap. Now you should get the compface package from this
site (ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/faces/).  and create the actual
X-face by saying

     cat file.xbm | xbm2ikon | compface > file.face
     cat file.face | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g;s/\"/\\\"/g;' > file.face.quoted
   If you can't use compface, there's an online X-face converter at
`http://www.dairiki.org/xface/'.  If you use MS Windows, you could also
use the WinFace program from `http://www.xs4all.nl/~walterln/winface/'.
Now you only have to tell Gnus to include the X-face in your postings
by saying

     (setq message-default-headers
             (with-temp-buffer
               (insert "X-Face: ")
               (insert-file-contents "~/.xface")
               (buffer-string)))
   in ~/.gnus.el.  If you use Gnus 5.10, you can simply add an entry

     (x-face-file "~/.xface")
   to gnus-posting-styles.

          (defadvice gnus-summary-reply (around reply-in-news activate)
            "Request confirmation when replying to news."
            (interactive)
            (when (or (not (gnus-news-group-p gnus-newsgroup-name))
                      (y-or-n-p "Really reply by mail to article author? "))

Question 5.11
.............

I want Gnus to locally store copies of my send mail and news, how to do

Answer

You must set the variable gnus-message-archive-group to do this. You
can set it to a string giving the name of the group where the copies
shall go or like in the example below use a function which is evaluated
and which returns the group to use.

     (setq gnus-message-archive-group
     	'((if (message-news-p)
     	      "nnml:Send-News"
     	    "nnml:Send-Mail")))

Question 5.12
.............

People tell me my Message-IDs are not correct, why aren't they and how
to fix it?

Answer
......

The message-ID is an unique identifier for messages you send. To make
it unique, Gnus need to know which machine name to put after the "@".
If the name of the machine where Gnus is running isn't suitable (it
probably isn't at most private machines) you can tell Gnus what to use
by saying:

     (setq message-user-fqdn "yourmachine.yourdomain.tld")
   in ~/.gnus.el.  If you use Gnus 5.9 or ealier, you can use this
instead (works for newer versions a well):

     (eval-after-load "message"
       '(let ((fqdn "yourmachine.yourdomain.tld"));; <-- Edit this!
          (if (boundp 'message-user-fqdn)
              (setq message-user-fqdn fqdn)
            (gnus-message 1 "Redefining `message-make-fqdn'.")
            (defun message-make-fqdn ()
              "Return user's fully qualified domain name."
              fqdn))))
   If you have no idea what to insert for "yourmachine.yourdomain.tld",
you've got several choices. You can either ask your provider if he
allows you to use something like yourUserName.userfqdn.provider.net, or
you can use somethingUnique.yourdomain.tld if you own the domain
yourdomain.tld, or you can register at a service which gives private
users a FQDN for free, e.g.
`http://www.stura.tu-freiberg.de/~dlx/addfqdn.html'.  (Sorry but this
website is in German, if you know of an English one offering the same,
drop me a note).

   Finally you can tell Gnus not to generate a Message-ID for News at
all (and letting the server do the job) by saying

     (setq message-required-news-headers
       (remove' Message-ID message-required-news-headers))
   you can also tell Gnus not to generate Message-IDs for mail by saying

     (setq message-required-mail-headers
       (remove' Message-ID message-required-mail-headers))
   , however some mail servers don't generate proper Message-IDs, too,
so test if your Mail Server behaves correctly by sending yourself a
Mail and looking at the Message-ID.

Question 6.1
............

How to import my old mail into Gnus?

Answer
......

The easiest way is to tell your old mail program to export the messages
in mbox format. Most Unix mailers are able to do this, if you come from
the MS Windows world, you may find tools at
`http://mbx2mbox.sourceforge.net/'.

   Now you've got to import this mbox file into Gnus. To do this,
create a nndoc group based on the mbox file by saying `G f
/path/file.mbox RET' in Group buffer. You now have read-only access to
your mail. If you want to import the messages to your normal Gnus mail
groups hierarchy, enter the nndoc group you've just created by saying
`C-u RET' (thus making sure all messages are retrieved), mark all
messages by saying `M P b' and either copy them to the desired group by
saying `B c name.of.group RET' or send them through
nnmail-split-methods (respool them) by saying `B r'.

Question 6.2
............

How to archive interesting messages?

Answer
......

If you stumble across an interesting message, say in gnu.emacs.gnus and
want to archive it there are several solutions. The first and easiest
is to save it to a file by saying `O f'. However, wouldn't it be much
more convenient to have more direct access to the archived message from
Gnus? If you say yes, put this snippet by Frank Haun
<pille3003@fhaun.de> in ~/.gnus.el:

     (defun my-archive-article (&optional n)
       "Copies one or more article(s) to a corresponding `nnml:' group, e.g.
     `gnus.ding' goes to `nnml:1.gnus.ding'. And `nnml:List-gnus.ding' goes
     to `nnml:1.List-gnus-ding'.

     Use process marks or mark a region in the summary buffer to archive
     more then one article."
       (interactive "P")
       (let ((archive-name
              (format
               "nnml:1.%s"
               (if (featurep 'xemacs)
                   (replace-in-string gnus-newsgroup-name "^.*:" "")
                 (replace-regexp-in-string "^.*:" "" gnus-newsgroup-name)))))
         (gnus-summary-copy-article n archive-name)))
   You can now say `M-x my-archive-article' in summary buffer to
archive the article under the cursor in a nnml group. (Change nnml to
your preferred back end)

   Of course you can also make sure the cache is enabled by saying

     (setq gnus-use-cache t)
   then you only have to set either the tick or the dormant mark for
articles you want to keep, setting the read mark will remove them from
cache.

Question 6.3
............

How to search for a specific message?

Answer
......

There are several ways for this, too. For a posting from a Usenet group
the easiest solution is probably to ask groups.google.com
(http://groups.google.com), if you found the posting there, tell Google
to display the raw message, look for the message-id, and say `M-^
the@message.id RET' in a summary buffer.  Since Gnus 5.10 there's also
a Gnus interface for groups.google.com which you can call with `G W')
in group buffer.

   Another idea which works for both mail and news groups is to enter
the group where the message you are searching is and use the standard
Emacs search `C-s', it's smart enough to look at articles in collapsed
threads, too. If you want to search bodies, too try `M-s' instead.
Further on there are the gnus-summary-limit-to-foo functions, which can
help you, too.

   Of course you can also use grep to search through your local mail,
but this is both slow for big archives and inconvenient since you are
not displaying the found mail in Gnus. Here comes nnir into action.
Nnir is a front end to search engines like swish-e or swish++ and
others. You index your mail with one of those search engines and with
the help of nnir you can search trough the indexed mail and generate a
temporary group with all messages which met your search criteria. If
this sound cool to you get nnir.el from
`ftp://ls6-ftp.cs.uni-dortmund.de/pub/src/emacs/' or
`ftp://ftp.is.informatik.uni-duisburg.de/pub/src/emacs/'.  Instructions
on how to use it are at the top of the file.

Question 6.4
............

How to get rid of old unwanted mail?

Answer
......

You can of course just mark the mail you don't need anymore by saying
`#' with point over the mail and then say `B DEL' to get rid of them
forever. You could also instead of actually deleting them, send them to
a junk-group by saying `B m nnml:trash-bin' which you clear from time
to time, but both are not the intended way in Gnus.

   In Gnus, we let mail expire like news expires on a news server. That
means you tell Gnus the message is expirable (you tell Gnus "I don't
need this mail anymore") by saying `E' with point over the mail in
summary buffer. Now when you leave the group, Gnus looks at all
messages which you marked as expirable before and if they are old
enough (default is older than a week) they are deleted.

Question 6.5
............

I want that all read messages are expired (at least in some groups).
How to do it?

Answer
......

If you want all read messages to be expired (e.g. in mailing lists
where there's an online archive), you've got two choices: auto-expire
and total-expire. Auto-expire means, that every article which has no
marks set and is selected for reading is marked as expirable, Gnus hits
`E' for you every time you read a message. Total-expire follows a
slightly different approach, here all article where the read mark is
set are expirable.

   To activate auto-expire, include auto-expire in the Group parameters
for the group. (Hit `G c' in summary buffer with point over the group
to change group parameters). For total-expire add total-expire to the
group-parameters.

   Which method you choose is merely a matter of taste: Auto-expire is
faster, but it doesn't play together with Adaptive Scoring, so if you
want to use this feature, you should use total-expire.

   If you want a message to be excluded from expiration in a group
where total or auto expire is active, set either tick (hit `u') or
dormant mark (hit `u'), when you use auto-expire, you can also set the
read mark (hit `d').

Question 6.6
............

I don't want expiration to delete my mails but to move them to another
group.

Answer
......

Say something like this in ~/.gnus.el:

     (setq nnmail-expiry-target "nnml:expired")
   (If you want to change the value of nnmail-expiry-target on a per
group basis see the question "How can I disable threading in some (e.g.
mail-) groups, or set other variables specific for some groups?")

Question 7.1
............

I don't have a permanent connection to the net, how can I minimize the
time I've got to be connected?

Answer
......

You've got basically two options: Either you use the Gnus Agent (see
below) for this, or you can install programs which fetch your news and
mail to your local disk and Gnus reads the stuff from your local
machine.

   If you want to follow the second approach, you need a program which
fetches news and offers them to Gnus, a program which does the same for
mail and a program which receives the mail you write from Gnus and
sends them when you're online.

   Let's talk about Unix systems first: For the news part, the easiest
solution is a small nntp server like Leafnode
(http://www.leafnode.org/) or sn (http://infa.abo.fi/~patrik/sn/), of
course you can also install a full featured news server like inn
(http://www.isc.org/products/INN/).  Then you want to fetch your Mail,
popular choices are fetchmail (http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/) and
getmail (http://www.qcc.ca/~charlesc/software/getmail-3.0/).  You
should tell those to write the mail to your disk and Gnus to read it
from there. Last but not least the mail sending part: This can be done
with every MTA like sendmail (http://www.sendmail.org/), postfix
(http://www.qmail.org/), exim (http://www.exim.org/) or qmail
(http://www.qmail.org/).

   On windows boxes I'd vote for Hamster (http://www.tglsoft.de/), it's
a small freeware, open-source program which fetches your mail and news
from remote servers and offers them to Gnus (or any other mail and/or
news reader) via nntp respectively POP3 or IMAP. It also includes a smtp
server for receiving mails from Gnus.

Question 7.2
............

So what was this thing about the Agent?

Answer
......

The Gnus agent is part of Gnus, it allows you to fetch mail and news
and store them on disk for reading them later when you're offline. It
kind of mimics offline newsreaders like e.g. Forte Agent. If you want
to use the Agent place the following in ~/.gnus.el if you are still
using 5.8.8 or 5.9 (it's the default since 5.10):

     (setq gnus-agent t)
   Now you've got to select the servers whose groups can be stored
locally.  To do this, open the server buffer (that is press `^' while
in the group buffer).  Now select a server by moving point to the line
naming that server.  Finally, agentize the server by typing `J a'.  If
you make a mistake, or change your mind, you can undo this action by
typing `J r'.  When you're done, type 'q' to return to the group buffer.
Now the next time you enter a group on a agentized server, the headers
will be stored on disk and read from there the next time you enter the
group.

Question 7.3
............

I want to store article bodies on disk, too. How to do it?

Answer
......

You can tell the agent to automatically fetch the bodies of articles
which fulfill certain predicates, this is done in a special buffer
which can be reached by saying `J c' in group buffer. Please refer to
the documentation for information which predicates are possible and how
exactly to do it.

   Further on you can tell the agent manually which articles to store
on disk. There are two ways to do this: Number one: In the summary
buffer, process mark a set of articles that shall be stored in the
agent by saying `#' with point over the article and then type `J s'. The
other possibility is to set, again in the summary buffer, downloadable
(%) marks for the articles you want by typing `@' with point over the
article and then typing `J u'.  What's the difference? Well, process
marks are erased as soon as you exit the summary buffer while
downloadable marks are permanent.  You can actually set downloadable
marks in several groups then use fetch session ('J s' in the GROUP
buffer) to fetch all of those articles.  The only downside is that
fetch session also fetches all of the headers for every selected group
on an agentized server.  Depending on the volume of headers, the initial
fetch session could take hours.

Question 7.4
............

How to tell Gnus not to try to send mails / postings while I'm offline?

Answer
......

All you've got to do is to tell Gnus when you are online (plugged) and
when you are offline (unplugged), the rest works automatically. You can
toggle plugged/unplugged state by saying `J j' in group buffer. To
start Gnus unplugged say `M-x gnus-unplugged' instead of `M-x gnus'.
Note that for this to work, the agent must be active.

Question 8.1
............

How to find information and help inside Emacs?

Answer
......

The first stop should be the Gnus manual (Say `C-h i d m Gnus RET' to
start the Gnus manual, then walk through the menus or do a full-text
search with `s'). Then there are the general Emacs help commands
starting with C-h, type `C-h ? ?' to get a list of all available help
commands and their meaning. Finally `M-x apropos-command' lets you
search through all available functions and `M-x apropos' searches the
bound variables.

Question 8.2
............

I can't find anything in the Gnus manual about X (e.g. attachments,
PGP, MIME...), is it not documented?

Answer
......

There's not only the Gnus manual but also the manuals for message,
emacs-mime, sieve and pgg. Those packages are distributed with Gnus and
used by Gnus but aren't really part of core Gnus, so they are
documented in different info files, you should have a look in those
manuals, too.

The two most important ones are the official Gnus website
(http://www.gnus.org).  and it's sister site my.gnus.org (MGO)
(http://my.gnus.org), hosting an archive of lisp snippets, howtos, a
(not really finished) tutorial and this FAQ.

Question 8.4
............

Which mailing lists and newsgroups are there?

Answer
......

There's the newsgroup gnu.emacs.gnus (also available as
gmane.emacs.gnus.user (http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.user))
which deals with general Gnus questions.  The ding mailing list
(ding@gnus.org) deals with development of Gnus. You can read the ding
list via NNTP, too under the name gmane.emacs.gnus.general
(http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.gnus.general) from news.gmane.org.

   If you want to stay in the big8, news.software.newssreaders is also
read by some Gnus users (but chances for qualified help are much better
in the above groups) and if you speak German, there's
de.comm.software.gnus.

Question 9.1
............

Starting Gnus is really slow, how to speed it up?

Answer
......

The reason for this could be the way Gnus reads it's active file, see
the node "The Active File" in the Gnus manual for things you might try
to speed the process up.  An other idea would be to byte compile your
~/.gnus.el (say `M-x byte-compile-file RET ~/.gnus.el RET' to do it).
Finally, if you have require statements in your .gnus, you could
replace them with eval-after-load, which loads the stuff not at startup
time, but when it's needed. Say you've got this in your ~/.gnus.el:

     (require 'message)
     (add-to-list 'message-syntax-checks '(sender . disabled))
   then as soon as you start Gnus, message.el is loaded. If you replace
it with

     (eval-after-load "message"
           '(add-to-list 'message-syntax-checks '(sender . disabled)))
   it's loaded when it's needed.

Question 9.2
............

How to speed up the process of entering a group?

Answer
......

A speed killer is setting the variable gnus-fetch-old-headers to
anything different from nil, so don't do this if speed is an issue. To
speed up building of summary say

     (gnus-compile)
   at the bottom of your ~/.gnus.el, this will make gnus byte-compile
things like gnus-summary-line-format.  then you could increase the
value of gc-cons-threshold by saying something like

     (setq gc-cons-threshold 3500000)
   in ~/.emacs. If you don't care about width of CJK characters or use
Gnus 5.10 or younger together with a recent GNU Emacs, you should say

     (setq gnus-use-correct-string-widths nil)
   in ~/.gnus.el (thanks to Jesper harder for the last two
suggestions). Finally if you are still using 5.8.8 or 5.9 and
experience speed problems with summary buffer generation, you
definitely should update to 5.10 since there quite some work on
improving it has been done.

Question 9.3
............

Sending mail becomes slower and slower, what's up?

Answer
......

The reason could be that you told Gnus to archive the messages you
wrote by setting gnus-message-archive-group. Try to use a nnml group
instead of an archive group, this should bring you back to normal speed.
