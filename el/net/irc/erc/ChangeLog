2005-05-31  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* debian/changelog: First draft of entries for the 5.0.3 release.

	* debian/README.Debian: Note that ERC will now install correctly
	on versions of Emacs or XEmacs that do not have the `format-spec'
	library.  Correct some grammar and prune the content a bit.

	* debian/scripts/install (emacs20): Remove line since we no longer
	need to deal with format-spec.el.

	* Makefile (VERSION): Change to 5.0.3.

	* NEWS: Add entries for the upcoming 5.0.3 release.

	* erc.el: Don't require format-spec since this is provided in
	erc-compat.el now.
	(erc-process-sentinel, erc-setup-periodical-server-ping): Use
	`erc-cancel-timer' instead of `cancel-timer'.
	(erc-version-string): Update to 5.0.3.

	* erc-autoaway.el (autoaway, erc-autoaway-reestablish-idletimer):
	Use `erc-cancel-timer' instead of `cancel-timer'.

	* erc-compat.el (format-spec, format-spec-make): If we cannot load
	the `format-spec' library, provide versions of these functions.
	This should keep problems from surfacing with Emacs21 Debian
	builds.
	(erc-cancel-timer): New function created to take the place of
	`cancel-timer' since XEmacs calls it something else.

	* erc-track.el (erc-modified-channels-update): Accept any number
	of arguments, which are ignored.  This allows it to be run from
	`erc-disconnected-hook' without extra bother.
	(track): Add `erc-modified-channels-update' to
	`erc-disconnected-hook' so that the indicators are removed
	correctly in some edge cases.
	(erc-modified-channels-display): Make sure that we never pass nil
	to the function in `erc-track-shorten-function'.  This happens
	when we have deleted buffers in `erc-modified-channels-alist'.
	Also, make sure that the buffer has a non-nil short-name before
	adding it to the string list.  This should fix some XEmacs
	warnings when running /quit with unchecked buffers, as well as get
	rid of a stray buffer problem (or so it is hoped).

2005-05-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-version-string): Move this up so that it is
	evaluated before the `require' statements.  Not a major change.

2005-04-27  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (debrelease): Use a slightly different approach when
	removing CVS and Arch cruft.

	* debian/changelog: Update for 5.0.2-1 package.

2005-04-25  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-autoaway.el (erc-autoaway-reestablish-idletimer): Move code
	block higher in file to fix a load failure when using Emacs21.
	Thanks to Daniel Brockman for the report and fix.

2005-04-24  Adrian Aichner  <adrian@xemacs.org>

	* erc-backend.el (JOIN): save-excursion so that
	`erc-current-logfile' inserts into the correct channel buffers
	when using erc-log-insert-log-on-open in combination with autojoin
	to multiple channels.

2005-04-06  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (debrelease): Ignore errors from deleting Arch and CVS
	metadata.

2005-04-05  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* ChangeLog, CREDITS, AUTHORS: Correct name and email address of
	Marcelo Toledo.

2005-04-04  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el: Apply latest non-ascii patch from Kai Fan.
	(erc-decode-parsed-server-response): Search
	erc-response.command-args for channel name.  Decode the
	erc-response struct using this channel name as key according to
	the `erc-encoding-coding-alist'.

	* erc-track.el: Apply patch from Henrik Enberg.
	(erc-modified-channels-object): Use optimal amount of whitespace
	around modified channels indicator.

2005-04-02  Johan Bockgård  <bojohan+sf@dd.chalmers.se>

	* erc.el (define-erc-module, erc-with-buffer)
	(erc-with-all-buffers-of-server, with-erc-channel-buffer): Add
	edebug-form-spec.

	* erc-compat (erc-define-minor-mode): Ditto.

2005-03-24  Johan Bockgård  <bojohan+sf@dd.chalmers.se>

	* erc-backend.el (define-erc-response-handler): Add
	`definition-name' property to constructed symbols so that
	find-function and find-variable will find them.

2005-03-21  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-dcc.el, erc-goodies.el, erc-list.el, erc-notify.el,
	erc-ring.el, erc.el: Copyright assignment occurred.

	* debian/scripts/install: Make a shell wrapper around the original
	Makefile and inline the Makefile.  The problem is that Debian
	passes all the Emacs variants at once, rotating them at every
	invocation of the install script, which happens once per variant.
	This caused each installation to happen N-1 times more often than
	it should have.  As a result, we need to only deal with the first
	argument.
	(ELFILES): Only add format-spec.el if we are compiling for
	emacs21.  Don't filter out erc-compat.el.
	(SITEFLAG): New variable that indicates that the "nosite" option
	should look like.
	(.DEFAULT): Use $(FLAVOUR) instead of $@ for clarity.

	* debian/rules: Install NEWS file and compress it.

	* debian/maint/postinst: Be more cautious about configuration
	step.

	* debian/copyright (Copyright): Another assignment came in.

	* debian/control (Standards-Version): Update to a newer version as
	recommended by lintian.

	* debian/changelog: Changes made for the Debian package.

	* debian/README.Debian: Keep only the General Notes section.

	* NEWS: Move old history items here from debian/README.Debian.

	* Makefile (SNAPSHOTDATE): Deprecate this option since we hope to
	release more often.

2005-03-20  Jorgen Schaefer  <forcer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* erc.el (erc-define-catalog, `ctcp-request-to'): Fix typo (%: ->
	%t:).

2005-03-02  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Add Kai Fan's patch to the list of changes.

	* Makefile (VERSION): Release version 5.0.2.

2005-03-01  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* NEWS: Add items corresponding to changes that I recently merged.

	* erc-log.el (erc-save-buffer-in-logs): Replace tabs with spaces
	in code indentation.

2005-02-28  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-display-message): Apply corrected patch from Henrik
	Enberg.

2005-02-27  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-display-message): Apply patch from Henrik Enberg.
	Check here to see if a message should be hidden, rather than
	relying on code in each individual command.

	* erc-backend.el (JOIN, KICK, MODE, NICK, PART, QUIT, TOPIC):
	Don't check `erc-hide-list' here.

	* erc-list.el, erc-match.el, erc.el, debian/copyright: Update
	copyright information as a few more people have assignments
	registered.

2005-02-06  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el: Apply patch from Kai Fan for non-ASCII character
	support.
	(erc-parse-server-response): Add call to
	`erc-decode-parsed-server-response'.
	(erc-decode-parsed-server-response): New function that decodes a
	pre-parsed server response before it can be handled.
	(PRIVMSG): Comment out call to `erc-decode-string-from-target'.
	(TOPIC): Ditto.

2005-02-01  Jorgen Schaefer  <forcer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* erc.el (erc-process-sentinel-1): Don't reconnect on connection
	refused. This error is reported differently when using
	open-network-stream-nowait.

2005-01-26  Francis Litterio <franl@world.std.com>

	* erc.el (erc-format-message): Silenced a byte-compiler warning
	about missing argument in call to `error'.

2005-01-26  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc.el (erc-cmd-APPENDTOPIC, erc-set-topic): The control
	character in `channel-topic' was changed to \C-o - replaced \C-c
	with \C-o so that these functions work as expected again.
	(erc-get-channel-mode-from-keypress): Doc fix.

2005-01-24  Johan Bockgård  <bojohan+sf@dd.chalmers.se>

	* erc.el (erc-input-action): Quote `erc-action-history-list' so
	that input history actually works.
	* erc-button.el (erc-button-add-face): Reverted my change to the
	order faces since it had the unwanted effect of putting the button
	face after all others.
	(erc-button-face-has-priority): Removed this variable as it is not
	necessary anymore - it was used to compensate for the above
	mentioned change.

	(erc-process-ctcp-query): Fix and simplify logic.
	(erc-get-channel-mode-from-keypress): Use `C-' string syntax.
	(erc-load-irc-script-lines): Use `erc-command-indicator' instead
	of `erc-prompt'.

2005-01-21  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* NEWS: Added the latest fixes.

2005-01-20  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc-button.el, erc-match.el:
	(erc-button-syntax-table, erc-match-syntax-table): Added \ as a
	legal character for nicknames.

	* erc-nets.el (erc-server-select): Fixed so that only networks
	with servers found in `erc-server-alist' are available as choices.

	* erc.el, erc-compat.el, erc-goodies.el:
	(erc-replace-match-subexpression-in-string): New function.  Needed
	because `replace-match' in XEmacs doesn't replace regular
	expression subexpressions in strings, only in buffers.
2005-01-19  Francis Litterio  <franl@world.std.com>

	* erc-button.el (erc-button-add-face): The face added by this
	function is more important than the existing text's face, so we
	now prepend erc-button-face to the list of existing faces when
	adding a button.  To instead append erc-button-face to existing
	faces, set variable `erc-button-face-has-priority' to nil.
	(erc-button-face-has-priority): New variable to control how
	erc-button-add-face adds erc-button-face to existing faces.
	(erc-button-press-button): Silenced a byte-compiler warning about
	too few arguments in a call to `error'.

2005-01-19  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* NEWS: Added list of 5.0.1 fixes.

	(erc-seconds-to-string, erc-controls-interpret): Use the new
	function.

	* erc-button.el (erc-button-add-button): Use the `:button-face'
	key combined with an `erc-mode' local `widget-button-face' set to
	nil to get the widget overlay face suppressed in XEmacs.

2005-01-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* AUTHORS: Move to format that cscvs can understand.  As an added
	perk, entries line up nicer.

	* erc.el, erc-fill.el, erc-pcomplete.el, debian/copyright: Merge a
	few more copyright lines thanks to Alex Schroeder's BBDB file.

	* erc.el (erc-version-string): Increment to 5.0.1.

	* Makefile: Change version to correspond with our new scheme.

2005-01-18  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc-list.el (erc-chanlist-channel-line-regexp): Now matches
	private channels, the channels `#' and `&', and channels with
	names including non-ascii characters.
	(erc-chanlist-join-channel): Don't attempt to join private
	channels since the channel name is unknown.

	* erc-goodies.el (erc-make-read-only): Add `rear-nonsticky'
	property to avoid `Text is read-only' errors during connection.
	`front-nonsticky' does not exist, changed to `front-sticky'.
	(erc-controls-interpret, erc-controls-strip): Just work on the
	string, don't open a temporary buffer.
	(erc-controls-propertize): Now accepts optional argument STR.

2005-01-17  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile: Version is 5.01, but only in the Makefile.  It has not
	been released yet.

	* erc-auto.in, erc-autojoin.el, erc-bbdb.el, erc-button.el,
	erc-chess.el, erc-complete.el, erc-dcc.el, erc-fill.el,
	erc-goodies.el, erc-ibuffer.el, erc-identd.el, erc-imenu.el,
	erc-list.el, erc-match.el, erc-menu.el, erc-nets.el,
	erc-netsplit.el, erc-nickserv.el, erc-notify.el, erc-pcomplete.el,
	erc-ring.el, erc-speak.el, erc-speedbar.el, erc-stamp.el,
	erc-track.el, erc-xdcc.el, erc.el, debian/copyright: Update
	copyright notices.  If anyone has signed papers for Emacs in
	general, merge them with the FSF's entry.

2005-01-16  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc.el (erc): `erc-set-active-buffer' was being called before
	`erc-process' was set, so that channels weren't being marked
	active correctly upon join; fixed.

2005-01-15  Johan Bockgård  <bojohan+sf@dd.chalmers.se>

	* erc-backend.el (def-edebug-spec): This macro caused problems (in
	XEmacs). Use its expansion directly.

2005-01-15  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc-button.el (erc-button-add-button): Reverted previous change
	since `:suppress-face' doesn't seem to be checked for a certain
	face.
	(erc-button-add-face): FACE is now appended to the `old' face.
	This should fix the problem of faces being "covered" by
	`erc-button-face'.

2005-01-14  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc.el, erc-backend.el (erc-cmd-OPS, erc-cmd-COUNTRY,
	erc-cmd-NICK, erc-process-ctcp-query, ERROR, PONG, 311, 312, 313,
	314, 317, 319, 320, 321, 322, 330, 352): Use catalog entries
	instead of hard-coded text messages.
	(english): Added new catalog entries `country', `country-unknown',
	`ctcp-empty', `ctcp-request-to', `ctcp-too-many', `nick-too-long',
	`ops', `ops-none', `ERROR', `PONG', `s311', `s312', `s313',
	`s314', `s317', `s317-on-since', `s319', `s320', `s321', `s322',
	`s330', and `s352'.
	(erc-send-current-line): Use `erc-set-active-buffer' (change was
	lost in previous bug fix).

2005-01-14  Francis Litterio  <franl@world.std.com>

	* erc-button.el (erc-button-add-button): Fixed a bug where the
	overlay created by widget-convert-button has a `face' property
	that hides the `face' property set on the underlying button text.

	* erc-goodies.el: Docstring fix.

	* erc-button.el: Improved docstring for variable erc-button-face.

2005-01-13  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc-menu.el (erc-menu-definition): "Topic set by channel
	operator": Small word change.  "Identify to NickServ...": Check
	that we're connected to the server.  Added "Save buffer in log"
	and "Truncate buffer".

2005-01-13  Lawrence Mitchell  <wence@gmx.li>

	* erc.el (erc-display-line-1): Widen before we try to insert
	anything, this makes sure input isn't broken when the buffer is
	narrowed by the user.
	(erc-beg-of-input-line): Simplify, just return the position of
	`erc-insert-marker' or error if does not exist.
	(erc-send-current-line): Widen before trying to send anything.

2005-01-13  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc.el, erc-backend.el, erc-list.el:
	(erc-update-mode-line-buffer): Strip controls characters from
	`channel-topic' since we add our own control character to it.
	(TOPIC, 332): Use \C-o instead of \C-c to force an end of IRC
	control characters as it also ends bold, underline, and inverse -
	\C-c only ends colors.
	(erc-chanlist-322): Strip control characters from channel and
	topic.  No need to interpret controls when we're applying overlays
	to the lines.

	* erc.el, erc-backend.el, erc-button.el, erc-netsplit.el,
	erc-nicklist.el: Fixed so that each server has an active buffer.
	(erc-active-buffer): Now a buffer-local variable.
	(erc-active-buffer, erc-set-active-buffer): New functions.
	(erc-display-line, erc-echo-notice-in-active-non-server-buffer,
	erc-process-away, MODE): Call `erc-active-buffer' to get the
	active buffer for the current server.
	(erc, erc-process-sentinel-1, erc-grab-region, erc-input-action,
	erc-send-current-line, erc-invite-only-mode,
	erc-toggle-channel-mode, erc-channel-names, MODE, erc-nick-popup,
	erc-nicklist-call-erc-command): Use `erc-set-active-buffer' to set
	the active buffer for the current server.
	(erc-cmd-WHOLEFT): Use 'active as BUFFER in `erc-display-message'.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-modified-channels): Server buffers are
	now treated the same as channels and queries.  This means that
	`erc-track-priority-faces-only', `erc-track-exclude', and
	`erc-track-exclude-types' now work with server buffers.

2005-01-12  Diane Murray  <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc-backend.el (475): Prompt for the channel's key if
	`erc-prompt-for-channel-key' is non-nil.  Send a new JOIN message
	with the key if a key is provided.

	* erc.el (erc-command-indicator): Fixed customization choices so
	that there's no `mismatch' message when nil is the value.

2005-01-11  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-bbdb.el (bbdb): Lowercase the name of the module.  This
	fixes a bug which caused an error to occur when trying to enable
	the module using the customization interface.

2005-01-08  Edward O'Connor  <ted@oconnor.cx>

	* erc-track.el: Support using faces to indicate channel activity
	in the modeline under XEmacs.
	(erc-modified-channels-object): New function.
	(erc-modified-channels-display): Use it.
	`erc-modified-channels-string' renamed to
	`erc-modified-channels-object' (because it's no longer a string on
	XEmacs). The new function `erc-modified-channels-object' is used
	to generate updated values for the same-named variable.

2005-01-08  Diane Murray <dsm@muenster.de>

	* ChangeLog.2002: Changed instances of my sourceforge username and
	email address to real name and email.

	* erc.el (erc-modules): Changed customization tag descriptions, so
	that they all start with a verb; added new modules to choices.

2005-01-08  Mario Lang  <mlang@delysid.org>

	* debian/rules: Introduce new variable DOCDIR to simplify stuff a
	bit.

2005-01-08  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog.2004: Change bpalmer's email address as
	requested.

	* CREDITS: Add everyone who is mentioned in the ChangeLogs.

	* debian/copyright (Copyright): Add last few people.  This can now
	be considered a complete list, as far as CVS entries are
	concerned.  If people have assigned copyright to the FSF, merge
	them with the entry for the FSF.

	* debian/README.Debian: Add entry for XEmacs-related change in
	`erc-track.el'.

	* erc.el (erc-cmd-MODE): New command that changes or displays the
	mode for a channel or user.  The functionality was present before
	this change, but there was no documentation for it.

	* erc-auto.in, erc-*.el: Fully investigate copyright headers and
	change them appropriately.  If a file has been pulled off of
	erc.el at one time, keep track of copyright from the time of
	separation, but not before.  If a file has been derived from a
	work outside of erc, keep copyright statements in place.

	* Makefile (VERSION): Change to 5.0! :^) Congrats on all the great
	work.  I'll wait until hober commits his XEmacs compatibility
	patch to erc-track.el, and then release.
	(distclean): Alias for `realclean' target.

2005-01-07  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	slightly.

	* debian/rules: Concatenate the ChangeLogs during the Debian

	(ChangeLog): Remove rule since we do not dynamically generate the
	ChangeLog anymore.

	* MkChangeLog: Removed since we do not use it to generate the
	ChangeLog anymore.  cvs2cl does a much better job anyway.

	* NEWS: Use 3rd level heading instead of bullets for lists that
	contain descriptions.

2005-01-07  Diane Murray <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc-list.el: Require 'sort.
	(erc-chanlist): Disable undo in the channel list buffer.

	* erc.el, erc-menu.el: The `IRC' menu is now automatically added
	to the menu-bar.  Add the call to `easy-menu-add' to
	`erc-mode-hook' when running in XEmacs (without this the menu
	doesn't appear).

	* NEWS: Added the information from
	http://emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ErcCvsFeatures and the newer
	changes which weren't yet documented on that page.

2005-01-06  Hoan Ton-That  <hoan@ton-that.org>

	* erc-log.el (erc-current-logfile): Only downcase the logfile
	name, not the whole filename.  Also expand relative to
	`erc-log-channels-directory'.
	(erc-generate-log-file-name-with-date)
	(erc-generate-log-file-name-short)
	(erc-generate-log-file-name-long): Don't expand filename, done in
	`erc-current-logfile'.

2005-01-06  Lawrence Mitchell  <wence@gmx.li>

	* NEWS: New file, details user visible changes from version to
	version.

	* HACKING (NEWS entries): Mention NEWS file, and what its purpose

	tasks.  Feel free to add to it.

	* debian/rules (binary-erc): Add ChangeLog files.

2005-01-04  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* ChangeLog.2001, ChangeLog.2002, ChangeLog.2003, ChangeLog.2004:
	ChangeLog entries from previous years.

	* ChangeLog: New file containing ChangeLog entries for the current
	year.  Please update this file manually whenever a change is
	committed.  This is a new policy.

	* AUTHORS: Add myself to list.  Some entries were space-delimited
	instead of TAB-delimited, and since the latter seemed to be the
	default, make the other entries conform.

	* HACKING (ChangeLog Entries): Update section to reflect new
	policy toward ChangeLog entries, which is that they should be
	manually updated whenever a change is committed.

2005-01-04  Diane Murray <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc.el (erc-connection-established, erc-login): Update the
	mode-line.
	(erc-update-mode-line-buffer): If `erc-current-nick' returns nil,
	use an empty string for ?n character in format spec.  Set
	`mode-line-process' to ":connecting" while the connection is being
	established.

2005-01-04  Lawrence Mitchell <wence@gmx.li>

	* AUTHORS: Update list of authors.

2005-01-02  Diane Murray <dsm@muenster.de>

	* erc-goodies.el (erc-control-characters): New customization
	group.
	(erc-interpret-controls-p): Small fix, addition to
	documentation. Updated customization to allow 'remove as a value.
	Use 'erc-control-characters as `:group'.
	(erc-interpret-mirc-color): Use 'erc-control-characters as
	`:group'.
	(erc-beep-p): Updated documentation.  Use 'erc-control-characters
	as `:group'.
	(define-erc-module irccontrols): Add `erc-controls-highlight' to
	`erc-insert-modify-hook' and `erc-send-modify-hook' since it
	changes the text's appearance.
	(erc-controls-remove-regexp, erc-controls-interpret-regexp): New
	variables.
	(erc-controls-highlight): Fixed so that highlighting works even if

	highlighting; now respecting `erc-interpret-mirc-color'.  Fixed a
	bug where emacs would get stuck in a loop when \C-g was in a
	message and `erc-beep-p' was set to nil (default setting).
