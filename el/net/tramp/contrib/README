This directory contains some files which are not part of Tramp but
are used by it.  Often, you don't need these files at all, because
your Emacs otherwise provides the necessary functionality.

base64.el
        The functionality is part of the Emacs C core since Emacs
        20.5 or so.  You can decide if you need it by typing `ESC :'
        and then entering the following command:
                (require 'base64)
        If Emacs prints "base64" in the echo area, you have the
        functionality and do not need the file.
        If Emacs prints an error message about being unable to open
        the file, then you need it.

format-spec.el
        This file is originally from Gnus.  So if your Emacs contains
        a sufficiently recent Gnus, you do not need this.  You can
        use the same check as above for finding out if you need it.
